Dating: Uncertain, but perhaps ca. 1230s CE, since T-S 13J26.6 (1234 CE) is a letter from Abū l-Majd in Qūṣ to Abū l-Mufaḍḍal in Fustat requesting guidance from the capital on communal affairs; if this decade is correct, plausible options are 1230 and 1237 CE (since the letter was written on Thursday, 1 Tammuz). Concerning a distinguished physician, evidently also the Head of the Jews (""Sayyidnā al-Rayyis"") whose burdensome medical responsibilities affected his ability to respond to the needs of the Jewish community. This physician is likely Avraham Maimonides based on the above identifications as well as corroborating evidence (cf. T-S 10J14.5 and Cohen's discussion of this possibility, pp. 134–35 in his article). The sender reports that two different queries for legal opinions (fatwās) had been sent to the physician in the Egyptian capital. He had misplaced the first query and had recovered it only after the second arrived. The sender informs the addressee, who had submitted the two questions, that the physician had composed an answer (jawāb) to both and it was enclosed it the present letter. The verso contains greetings from Abū l-Faraj, Abū l-Riḍā, Yosef, Hiba, and their mother, as well as the address. Upside down, there is also a list of medicinal herbs in Arabic script, unrelated to the letter. The scribe of this letter has distinctive handwriting with very tall, hooked lameds.

In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: ca. 1100 CE. Evidently this letter was never sent. The writer has spent the last five years in Egypt attempting to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He describes the various disasters of the years 1095–1100 to justify both why he has failed to reach Jerusalem and why too he has remained in Egypt instead of returning to his family and waṭan. First, he describes the chaos in Palestine under the Seljuq occupation (""many armed bands made their appearance in Palestine""). He next describes the 1095 siege of Alexandria in which the vizier al-Afḍal deposed Nizār and secured the caliphate for al-Mustaʿlī (""the city was ruined. . . the Sultan conquered the city and caused justice to abound""). He again prepared for travel ""when God conquered Jerusalem at his [the caliph's] hands,"" i.e., in 1098, only to be foiled by the appearance of the Franks, who ""killed everyone in the city, whether Jew or Muslim."" The writer is confident that the Fatimids will retake Jerusalem this very year, so he intends to remain in Egypt until he sees Jerusalem or gives up all hope. The letter ends with the writer's protracted illnesses. Throughout these years, the land has been filled with epidemic diseases (wabā', aʿlāl, amrāḍ, dever). The wealthy became impoverished, ""most people died,"" entire families were destroyed. The writer himself developed a grave illness (maraḍ ṣaʿb), which lasted one year, and was shortly followed by another grave illness, which has lasted four years and perhaps continues to the present day. ""Indeed [true is] what the Scripture has said of the dreadful disease of Egypt (Deut. 7:15). . . . He who hiccups (yastanshiq) will not escape from it. . . . ailments and will die from them. . . . Otherwise, he will remain alive."" Note that ""yastanshiq"" typically means ""inhale"" or ""snuff"" (e.g., water for ritual ablutions) rather than ""hiccup."" Information largely from Goitein's attached translation and notes, and Goldman, ""Arabic-Speaking Jews in Crusader Syria"" (diss.), pp. 38–42, where there is a thorough analysis of the letter's context and a discussion of the writer's penchant for hyperbole.","Moshe Gil, Palestine During the First Muslim Period (634–1099)‎ (in Hebrew) (1983), vol. 3. ; S.

(3) Maʿālī will live with Manṣūr's daughter Milāḥ, likely the daughter of ʿAmāʾim (Goitein speculated that ʿAmāʾim must have suffered from a physical or mental illness preventing her from taking care of her own daughter).

This petitioner was one of them, a widow who paid the ransom fees or part of them in installments, one dinar at a time. Abū l-Barakāt had previously helped her and suggested that she leave a dinar with him until she needed it, since ransom fees weren't always paid promptly.

This is the only known document that refers to the majlis of Maimonides. It is a draft of a statement (tiqrār) to be signed by Maimonides, the Judges and the Elders, to the effect that Avraham b. Yaḥyā ha-Levi, called al-Najīb, should get the payment of his capitation tax (jizya) to the amount of 1 2/3 dinars out of the revenue from the rents of a ""block"" (rabʿ) which was a pious foundation earmarked for poor people. Thus Avraham's capitation tax will be paid from the revenue of the qodesh, not as charity, but as compensation for fees which he once renounced for supervising repairs in the funduq. The text stresses the great benefit which would accrue from his continued presence at such repairs. This payment was to be in the place of a daily salary of 1/2 dirham to which al-Najīb was entitled for his supervision of the building of the Funduq ('hotel' or caravenserai), erected by Abū ʿImran Beḥir ha-Kohanim, certainly also a public building. The remuneration of 1/2 dirham normally was paid out of a daily emolument of 2 dirhams which the Wakīl or administrator of the building received. The statement is not signed, perhaps because Maimonides objected to such a vague agreement made in respect of the spending of money destined for the poor. (Information from Goitein's notes and from Gil, Documents, pp. 323 #77.)

After four (months?), the former captive returned to the house of her foster-mother and declared that she wouldn't stay with him.

Description from PGPID 9079:
Letter from Yiṣḥaq Ibn ʿEzra to Ḥalfon b. Netanel. In Judaeo-Arabic. Location: Spain. Dating: Perhaps the end of summer, 1138 CE. Dealing with the return of a defective mithqāl. Together with his business partner Yiṣḥaq b. ʿOvadya (who is incidentally sick), the writer has sent Ḥalfon a large shipment of 500 sheets of paper. Ḥalfon had business relationships with both parties, and the price of the paper will be credited toward Yiṣḥaq b. ʿOvadya's account with Ḥalfon. Ibn ʿEzra writes that he plans to visit Ḥalfon the following week, and he passes on regards from two Muslim viziers: Abū Muḥammad b. Abū Rajā and Abū Isḥāq b. Wāziʿ. Description based on India Book.

""Al-Kabīra"" and Nahray's wife are in Jerusalem, and it is possible that their visit is connected to this matter, that is to say, that they came to pray for a male son. The letter contains various details about the Maghrebis who are in Jerusalem. People are worried about a drought, and the price of wheat is rising. Abūn also mentions his books, which he brought from the West and left with Yeshuʿa ha-Kohen b. Yosef in Alexandria. Abūn reports that he has sold most of the quarter dinars which are mentioned in the other letters, and thus it is possible to deduce the year of this letter. Abūn reports that R.

Moshe b. Sughmār, the chief judge in al-Mahdiyya, to Nahray b. Nissim, in Fustat. Dating: Ca. 3 August 1057 CE (Gil) or 1061 CE (Goitein). Goitein explains, ""Our letter was written after 1057, the date of the ruin of Qayrawān, when R. Nissim (b. Yaʿaqov) and other inhabitants of that city had found refuge in Sūsa, a seaport on the Tunisian coast north of al-Mahdiyya. R. Nissim died in 1062.The reference to the Sicilian city whose male inhabitants were put to sword by the conquering Normans fits the fall of Messina in 1061."" Labrāṭ extols the great rabbinical authority R. Nissim b. Yaʿaqov, and his pupil the enigmatic ""Rav"" of Egypt. At the time of the writing of this letter, R. Nissim lived in Sūsa. There he supervised the copying of his writings, which was done for the Qayrawān scholar, Nahray b. Nissim, who then lived in Egypt. The letter relates how R. Nissim's writings were transferred to Egypt, an important detail, which sheds light on the value of the Geniza fragments of these writings, which have been published by Sheraga Abramson. Labrāṭ reports on the progress of the court case that Nahray b. Natan brought against his brother Yisrael b. Natan (both of them the cousins of Nahray b. Nissim) regarding the inheritance of their father's estate. The letter hails the zeal and progress made in Jewish learning by a son of R. Natan b. Avraham, Av ha-Yeshiva, the sometime Gaon of the Palestinian academy. The letter concludes with a report of the conquests made by the Normans in Sicily. The reference is to their taking of Messina by assault, and the losses suffered by Jews and, in particular, by Muslims. The writer expresses apprehensions with regard to the import of grain from Sicily, since Tunisia itself, a primarily agricultural country, had been laid waste by the invasion of the Arab tribes. Labrāṭ opens the letter with copious well wishes to Nahray because of his eye disease (wajaʿ ʿayn and ḍuʿf ʿayn) and conveys well wishes to Nahray on behalf of R. Nissim (r4–11). Goitein cites this letter as an excellent example of the convention of expressing preoccupation for a sick correspondent and conveying congratulations upon his recovery: ""After having read the bad tidings in Nahray's missives, [Labrāṭ] had become disquieted and frightened, and passed his sleepless nights in asking God to accept himself as Nahray's ransom and to heal him. He had also passed the news on to ""the Light of the World"" (the spiritual leader of the Tunisian Jews), who was also very worried about it; his prayer for Nahray, Labrāṭ is confident, would be accepted. Finally, the merchants arriving from Egypt reported that Nahray was well and his eyes restored, whereupon Labrat praised and thanked God. He would be set at rest, however, only by a personal letter from Nahray confirming this happy turn of events"" (Goitein, Med Soc V, p. 111). Labrāṭ goes on to describe the serious illness of R. Nissim himself (r14–18). All had despaired, ""but God looked upon us and did not afflict us and blind our eyes."" R. Nissim recovered, but the remnants of the illness did not leave him for a long time. Information from Goitein and Gil. There are photostats and an edition in Goitein's notes (to be uploaded).

Dated: Tishrei 1449 Seleucid, which is 1137 CE. Testator: Sitt al-Ahl bt. Ṣadoq b. Mevorakh Rosh ha-Qehillot. Sitt al-Ahl is the wife of Abū l-Faraj Yeshuʿa b. Yehuda. Sitt al-Ahl's mother is Ḥasana bt. Shelomo ha-Kohen, the sister of the well-known judge Natan b. Shelomo. She is close to giving birth and contemplating dying during childbirth and seeks to provide for the child “male or female” who would survive the mother. The woman bequeaths generously to relatives and charities, including “forty dinars to the ""mastūrīn"" poor in Cairo and Fustat. ""The woman's husband had children from a previous marriage, and she was, therefore particularly eager to safeguard the future of the child she was expecting. This had already been done to a large extent in her marriage contract, where it was stipulated that the dowry which she brought in, as well as payments due to her, would go to her children, to the exclusion of other heirs of her husband. In addition, she now wants half of a house, given by her to her mother prior to her marriage, to revert to her future child. The other half belonged to her, and both she and her husband were eager that the whole should become the property of the expected newborn. The old lady, however, had earmarked 60% of her share for her brother and nieces and 40% for charitable purposes. In view of this, our document stipulates that the gifts intended by the old woman will be made by her son-in-law in case after her death, while the half of the house referred to will be registered as property of the newborn. The expecting mother belonged to one of the leading families of the community, as her grandfather was Mevorakh Rosh ha-Qehillot, a man prominent in the politics of the community in the middle of the 11th century. On the other hand, her maternal uncle, the judge Natan ha-Kohen b. Shelomo, signatory of many documents in Fustat during the years 1122–48, was a refugee from Palestine, which was occupied at that time by the crusaders. It stands to reason that her mother, too, had come from Palestine and had, therefore, no possessions of her own in Cairo. This explains why she was given in her old age, one-half of a house by her daughter, who had inherited or received it as a gift from her father's family, or perhaps left to her by a former husband.""

Nissim, trade","Letter from Marduk b. Musa, Alexandria, to Nahray b. Nissim, Fustat, about a shipment of yarn from Fustat to Alexandria. Marduk notes that a baqyar (large-sized turban) 25 cubits long was made for Nahray, along with a bolt of cloth 20 cubits long. He further reports that ‘Atiyya b. Shammāʿ brought him a blue kerchief containing cotton, [linen] yarn and unraveled flax, which would be combined with yarn previously sent — and currently in the hands of the artisan — to produce another cloth, but that since the yarns were of different qualities, it didn't bleach well. The letter reveals the importance of Alexandria as a center of textile weaving: in this case, yarn and other raw materials (e.g., combed flax—kattān manfūsh) were sent from Fustat to Alexandria for processing into finished products. The length of Nahray's turban, 25 cubits, is noteworthy and confirms the importance of this item of headgear as a symbol of status. Another interesting detail is the process of bargaining with artisans: the price for certain work is fixed, and as the work proceeds, attempts are made to bargain down the price at various stages; this
continues even after the work has been completed. The processes connected with weaving that are
either mentioned or implied in this letter are:
a)	ghazl: spinning
b)	ḥall al-ghazl: unravelling the yarn
c)	tasfiya: bleaching
d)	tabyīḍ; whitening (re: flax and linen)
e)	qasr: fulling/cleaning of woven material

Yehuda to a personality in Fustat. Dating (Gil): ca. 1030 CE. Describes the aftermath of the excommunication of the Qaraites on the Mount of Olives on Hoshaʿna Rabba in 1029. The Qaraites had demanded that those who declared the ḥerem, who were now imprisoned in Damascus, would ""never again be called by the title ḥaver and never serve the house of Israel in all of Palestine, in greater or lesser service, neither in law nor in any other matter” (quotation from T-S 13J13.28 + T-S AS 120.62, PGPID 949). There followed a meeting in the market in Ramla to discuss the Qaraite demands; the gaʾon says that he asked “that the matter be resolved without a stipulation [being placed] either upon or against” the Rabbanites. The Qaraites refused: “Rather, they said, ‘Our time has come! This is the day we have hoped for; we have lived to see it!"" (Lamentations 2:16) Then he goes off on a long aside complaining about the Qaraites elders of Jerusalem — in a more intimate tone than in his vatic Hebrew letters: they can't agree on a single point of law (""they differ from each other in school of law, each one forming his own madhhab""), yet they are unanimous in their hatred of the Rabbanites. He refers obliquely and mockingly to Qaraite authors such as Daniʾel al-Qūmisī, Salmon b. Yeroḥam and Yefet b. ʿEli: ""They see themselves as ‘lilies’ (shoshanim) and everyone else as ‘thorns’; they consider themselves ‘wise ones’ (maskilim), but they disagree as to who among them is wise.” Some other details of this live polemic session are equally fascinating: the gaʾon complains about their lack of fellow-feeling, and the Qaraites retort that they're the ones serving the state in the interest of the Jewish collectivity: “They should be ashamed. Which of us is obligated to his followers concerning the many laws of Israel that are not written, we or they? But when one mentions this to them, they feel ashamed and say, ‘It is not so. If God, may He be exalted, gave us a high position in the service of power [fī khidmat sulṭān], it was so that our followers might attain their wishes over others.” In response to which the gaʾon drops a short citation from Ecclesiastes (7:15–18) warning against attributing worldly success to divine favor: “[Sometimes a righteous man perishes in spite of his righteousness, and sometimes a wicked one endures in spite of his wickedness. So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise, or you might be disappointed, and do not be excessively wicked or excessively foolish, or you might die before your time.] It is best to grasp one without letting go of the other.” Then he continues complaining about the Qaraites' lack of fellow-feeling while noting that they nonetheless continue to marry Rabbanites:  ""They have marked us with the status of one whose prayer God does not accept, but if to them we appear thus, why should they procreate with us or marry us?"" He then refers to the continuation of the affair: the Rabbanites had succeeded in blocking the Qaraite demands through the mediation of Fatimid officials: “‘Blessed is the Lord, God of our fathers, who put it into the mind of ’our lord ‘the king’ [cf. Ezra 7:27], may he live forever, and into the mind of our lord the vizier, may God save him, to speak on our behalf and to seek what is good for us, may His name be elevated for all eternity.” Presumably this refers to T-S 13J7.29 (PGPID 1243), a decree of al-Ẓāhir to the governor of Palestine, Anūshtakīn al-Duzbarī, ordering him not to show partiality in his treatment of “the two parties,” a decree issued in response to a petition from the gaʾon's party. Then he goes on to describe how some Rabbanites in Jerusalem had spread a rumor saying that the Qaraites had burnt three Rabbanite figures in effigy on Purim. He sends the elders Abū l-Barakāt Netanʾel ha- Kohen and Abū ʿAlī Muḥsin b. Ḥusayn on a fact-finding mission, and the effigy story turns out to be slander; Abū ʿAlī Muḥsin b. Ḥusayn advises the gaʾon ""that I had no way out of this libel but to announce an excommunication on whoever did what was said and on whoever spread slander of non-existent things in order to endanger people.” The gaʾon complies and declares another ban ""on a fast day in the majlis in the Jewish market” in Ramla, urging his followers ""not to exact retribution on them (the Qaraites) for what they have inflicted upon us.” The assembly answered: “Cast the ban and cast the ban! Behold, we are suffering mightily from the terrible thing they (the slanderers) have said, even though it happened against our will. [Cast the ban] lest a decree [ḥujja] be issued against us [saying] that this happened because of us!” So he did (verso): “we cast the ban and we ended [the affair], but it troubled many of them, since they knew that they were [the ones] bringing this about.” (Information from Rustow, Heresy, 218–26.)

The letter includes a report on the social uproar caused by Yehuda ha-Levi’s visit in Alexandria when everybody was eager to invite him. The letter contains a request for Ḥalfon to come to Alexandria to settle the disputes caused by Yehuda ha-Levi’s presence in the city. The letter also refers to business matters arising from the India trade, in which both the addressee and the writer were involved. Abū Naṣr complains about his eye illness: ""I only wrote these few letters as I was housebound with a flare of ophthalmia that came over me."" At the end of recto and beginning of verso, this proves relevant: ""The account is in the shop and I am at home, so I do not have the precise details to inform you."" Finally, in the last few lines, ""Please extend forgiveness, God knows that I wrote this with the kerchief (khirqa) draped (musabala) over my eyes."" The use of a dark kerchief to protect the inflamed eyes from light was part of the standard treatment for ophthalmia (see the tag ""khirqa"" and the chapter on ramad in Tadhkirat al-Kaḥḥālīn).

Eli, Isaac b. Samuel ha-Sefaradi","Legal document. Partnership record. Dated July 1103. Written in the hand of Hillel b. Eli. This fragment concerns ownership interest in a partnership between Mōda‘ and Avraham al-‘Assāl. In the document, Mōda‘ calls upon Abū al-Faraj al-Bazzāz to testify that Mōda‘ has an interest in the partnership, while Avraham seems to claim that he or he and his wife are the sole owners of the capital. Avraham apparently invested capital with Mōda‘ for the operation of a shop, and upon distribution of the profits it became unclear whether the capital was intended to be simply a deposit with Mōda‘ or if it would be (per Maimonides) ""half a loan…and half a deposit"". Apparently, these details were left unspecified when Mōda‘ first became involved in the venture. Subsequently, Mōda‘ seems to have called two individuals – one (perhaps a scholar) identified only as Head of the Congregations (""Rosh ha-Qehillot""), and Abū al-Faraj – to the shop to clarify the nature of his relationship with Avraham. Thus, the present document reports that the Head of the Congregations affirmed in a qinyan that Mōda‘ was indeed a partner with Avraham and not simply an employee. Signed by Avraham b. Shemayah, Yiṣḥaq b. Shemu'el, and Yefet b. Avraham.

Record f release. Dated: February 1095. Location: Fustat. This document was drawn up following the termination and settlement of a commenda between Solomon b. David al-Dustarī/al-Tustarī and Benaiah b. Moses. As part of the settlement, Solomon was allocated ten dinars and change, five dinars and one qirāṭ to be paid immediately by Benaiah. The balance is to be collected by Solomon, acting as an agent to collect on debts owed by Jacob al-Ḥarīrī and Jacob al-Ṣabbāgh to Benaiah. The debtors will then make monthly payments of the balance to Solomon. Benaiah stands as guarantor for the debts. This document is a final release from Solomon to Benaiah, leaving only the uncollected debts. Goitein writes that ""the investor lost almost 50 out of 70 dinars confided to an overseas trader, but was convinced by ‘the elders of the community’ that he had no claim against him."" The ""convincing"" seems to have been the normal settlement procedure required for release; though the document refers to the agreement as a commenda (muḍāraba), its details don't confirm that it totally follows the model of the Islamic muḍāraba – for example, the active partner is left owing funds to the investor, suggesting that simply liquidating the invested assets was insufficient to satisfy his obligations to the latter. However, had the active partner borne no responsibility for loss (as in an Islamic muḍāraba), this would have sufficed. The verso – as yet untranscribed – is a form for a power of attorney, with ""John Doe"" substituted for parties’ names. This document seems to be unrelated to the recto, despite the allusion to a power of attorney (""wakāla"").

The two overseers of the qodesh who were in charge of an unnamed compound complained about arrears of two months owed by one of the tenants, Abu'l-Ḥasan b. al-Hazzan. The tenant in the meantime has left the apartment. The complaint was addressed to the gaon, the head of the yeshiva, himself. He asked one of the parnasim of the qodesh to inquire about the matter. The writer brings the results of his inquiry to the knowledge of the Judge. The inquiry has shown that there were no real arrears, but to make the matter totally right, a copper lid left by the tenant was to be handed over to Abu'l-Bayan, apparently one of the prominent leaders of the congregation of the Palestinians, in order to spare the parnasim his reproaches.

Dated 21 July 1137. ""The Emperor John II Comnenus was on his way to Antioch—held at that time by Raymond of Poitiers—and a part of his powerful army passed through the town in which this letter was written. The Byzantines arrived before the gates of Antioch on August 29. Our letter, however, reports a rumor that the city had already fallen forty days earlier. The writer, a physician, even expresses the expectation that the Emperor might take Aleppo and Damascus as well and already placed an order for medical books which would be looted there from the homes of his colleagues."" The writer had emigrated from Fatimid Egypt to Byzantium. Goitein suggests that he traveled initially with the Fatimid navy, as he lists letters he sent in previous years from the army camp at Jaffa, from Rhodes, and from the island of Chios, which were occupied by the Venetian navy in 1224. The physician also stayed in Constantinople before settling in Seleucia and marring a woman with a Greek name (Korasi). He repeatedly describes how wealthy he is despite having arrived penniless, and urges his in-laws to follow his example and join him, no matter how much they have to leave behind. [Recto 1-8:] He opens with a discussion of the fertility of his sister; she has already borne two girls to the recipient, who is now presumably hoping for a son. She has not been able to become pregnant ""due to her emaciated state""; the writer believes he would be able to give her medications to allow her to conceive ""even after the emaciation."" (Goitein's reads shurb instead of shaḥb, and zawāl instead of huzāl, yielding, ""My sister did not become pregnant despite the many medicines. If you were here, I would fix her pregnancy, by my life, even after she had ceased to bear children."") The writer's own wife never conceived except with medication. [Recto 8-9:] The writer was unable to cure Avraham, ""the little beggar from Akko,"" who died and left his son an orphan. [Recto 10-17:] The writer provides a detailed list of the dowry that he gave his son-in-law Shemuel b. Moshe b. Shemuel the Longobardian merchant, worth altogether 200 dinars. [Recto 17-21:] The writer explains that his own letters may have never arrived because he used to send valuable materia medica with them, including mulberry concentrate (<em>rubb tūt</em>), ribes (<em>rībās</em>), barberries (<em>barbārīs</em>), Gentiana (<em>ghāfit</em>) leaves and extract, and absinthe (<em>afsintīn</em>). [Recto 21-27:] He lists the five letters he has sent in past years in exchange for only one from the recipients, including Abū Zikrī Yaḥyā and Abū Naṣr b. Isḥāq. [Recto 27-31:] He offers messianic wishes, citing Daniel 12:11 and a piyyut for Havdala written by the recipient's father. [Recto 31-38:] He writes of his great happiness and wealth, including a house worth 200 dinars and 400 barrels of wine. [Verso 1-4:] If the recipient really does join him, he should bring the medical books that the writer left behind. Regardless, he is hoping to obtain some medical books from the loot of Aleppo and Damascus. [Verso 4-22:] He conveys news of family and friends.

The writer has had no news of the addressee's family ever since he traveled, so he asks them to write to him with their news (r5–12). He sends his gratitude to Umm Khalaf and to the wife of the ḥaver, Umm Bū ʿAlī, probably for their hospitality (r12–18).

He asks the addressee to be diligent in 'doing the thing I mentioned with those people, for it will save our lives, with this weakness (ḍuʿf) we are in (again ambiguous: ḍuʿf can refer to illness or financial need or any difficult strait) (r18–22).

Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥibrī, his brother Futūḥ claimed his inheritance and the court establishes that as their third brother (Abū Saʿīd) has already died, Futūḥ is indeed the only known heir. Fol. 1, verso (doc. b): Abū Saʿīd Khalaf/Ḥalfon (aka ""Segulat ha-Nedivim"" or simply ""al-Segulat"") received 18 dinars from Abū l-Maʿālī Shemuel the trader, who had been guarantor on behalf of the banker from al-Maḥalla Abū l-Maʿālī b. ʿOvadya for the orphan Bayān b. Ḥashīsh(!). The court orders Ḥalfon to keep the money as a deposit for the orphan. Dated: Adar 1470 Seleucid, which is 1159 CE. Fol. 2, recto and verso (doc. c): Trousseau list (taqwīm). Bride: Sitt al-Maʿālī bt. Mevorakh ha-Kohen. Groom: Netanel b. Aharon ha-Kohen. Dating: Between Nisan and Sivan 1470 Seleucid, which is 1159 CE (based on the records that appear before and after). The marriage gifts amounted to 30 plus 80 dinars. The ornaments and dressing table objects brought to the bride were evaluated as worth 155 dinars. Both spouses were Kohens and probably cousins. (S. D. Goitein, Mediterranean Society, 4:343, 466.) Fol. 3, recto (doc. d): Two entries, unclear if they are related. Above, the court orders Abū l-Faraj Ibn al-Shofeṭ to provide sustenance (mezonot) for his wife Sārra for a period of 30 days Dated: Wendesday, 9 Sivan 1470 Seleucid, which is 1159 CE. (An earlier description on PGP said that this is probably a payment for the deferment of a marriage.) Below is another trousseau list (taqwīm). Bride and groom are not named, which is perhaps an argument for connecting this to the entry above. Payments are 5 + 17.

The two partners are to transact in ""medicinal commodities""; their business will transport these commodities between Fusṭāṭ and Cairo.  Profits and losses are to be shared evenly. Goitein calls this a commenda, perhaps because Abū al-Fakhr’s investment dwarfs that of Khalaf, although both of the partners are to trade actively. On the other hand, the partners agree to avoid deceiving each other and relying upon divine supervision, suggesting that the two do not work side-by-side at all times.

Location: Fustat. Dated: Wednesday, 26 Iyyar 1454 Seleucid, which is 13 April 1143 CE, under the reshut of Shemuel b. Ḥananya. Testator: Sitt al-Ahl bt. Abū l-Munā al-ʿAṭṭār al-Iskandarānī, the wife of Abū Naṣr al-Ḥalabī al-Tājir. Witnesses: Yosef b. Thābit ha-Levi; Shelomo b. Natan ha-Haver. ""This remarkable deathbed declaration, on the one hand, shows the cosmopolitan character of Fustat: the daughter of a druggist called 'the Alexandrian' was married there to a merchant 'from Aleppo.' On the other hand, it betrays an extraordinary attachment of the testator to her paternal family and to local customs and concepts. The dying woman's husband was a tājir, or great merchant, who traveled far and was expected to be away from home for several years. He probably was on a business trip to India. She had a little boy (Mūsā) from a former marriage, who lived with her parents. As his guardian and her own executor she appointed a brother of her former husband (Abū Mūsā Hārūn/Aharon b. Yeshuʿa ha-Kohen). The main purport of the will was the legal protection of her parents, brother (Abū l-Surūr), and boy against her present husband and providing a sumptuous burial for herself. She wanted to have Muslim wailing women, presumably because the cries and shrieks of Jewish women exercising the same profession were not shrill enough for her taste. The most impressive detail is her wish to be buried together with 'one of her family' meaning her father, mother, or brother. To these she was attached by 'natural ties'; with her husband she was connected solely by a 'contract.'"" There is also a clause about Sitt al-Ahl's female slave named Fūq and Fūq's daughter, who belongs to Sitt al-Ahl's mother. Sitt al-Ahl also intends for the daughter of her brother Abū l-Surūr to marry her son Mūsā.

If Joseph fails to make full payment, he must make a donation to the poor in the same amount as he owes. Khalaf is to be trusted (presumably, without an oath) concerning Joseph's payments.

The nature of the tax is not specified; Goitein presumes that it was for the tax on the manufacture, dyeing, and sale of silk.

Then I pondered over the straitened circumstances of these people, their liabilities and indebtedness to the dīwān and thought that if I took that thing from them through machinations, force, and getting the better of them, they would suffer damage, both from the side of their relation with the dīwān and their loss of income. Thus, considering their welfare prior to my own and confident that with God's favorable decree and help the welfare of all us would be served, I make this proposal."" The value of the tax farming lease is 335 dinars per year. The proposal is that they will transfer the rights to the tax farm to Abū l-Riḍā, and he will pay their debt of 80 dinars to the dīwān in four annual installments of 20 dinars. If the superintendent (mushrif) and director (ʿāmil) of the diwan raise the sum owed for the new tax farmer, the amount of the 'rise' (ziyāda) will be deducted from the 80 dinars.

In the handwriting of Moshe b. Levi ha-Levi. Moshe later cut it very neatly down the middle, yielding ENA 2558.18 and T-S 13J7.12, and wrote a family letter on the verso of each half. The deed concerns the dissolution of a partnership in a house and in a store between Khalaf and Abū l-Faḍl, the sons of Hilāl. It seems that Khalaf retained the store, while Abū l-Faḍl bought out Khalaf's half of the house for 16.5 dinars.

Partnership document. Location: Fustat. Dating: 1100 (per Goitein). This document, signed by Yitzhak b. Shemuʾel ha-Sefaradi, describes itself as a partnership document enacted between Abraham al-Mirjānī b. Moses and Mevorakh b. Eleazar, though details as to the partnership itself and the divison of profits and losses are missing from the preserved portion and much of the language is reminiscent of release documents. Each of the partners is given a copy of the document. The clauses here concerning soundness of mind are common in release documents as well. They also appear in both power of attorney and partnership agreements. While it is logical that soundness of mind would be required while releasing an erstwhile partner or while appointing an agent and releasing him from certain claims, it is odd that these clauses would appear when a new partnership relationship is formed. The soundness of mind clauses in the partnership release documents mirror those clauses seen in divorce or debt settlements, wills and release documents, suggesting that soundness of mind is required when one relinquishes a right.  The document was written on Wednesday, 1 Sivan ""in the year dated above"" (which is not visible in the extant text) and signed the following day.

Another possibility is ""akhī""/brother, since the scribe does not carefully distinguish between כ and ב.) The death has led to various financial/business complications. The addressees are to send him all the things they are supposed to send, ""just as you would to your father."" The sender did not want to write a power of attorney as he has done with others.

I do not rely on anyone else to concern themselves with him. My bed adjoins his; I get up several times every night to cover him and to turn him, since he is not able to do any of these things alone (idh lā yamlik min nafsihi shay'). May God, the exalted, reward him for his sufferings."" Med Soc III, p. 241. Later in the letter, Shimʿon tells Ballūṭa that she need not concern herself with sending the turban that had been requested, ""for, woe is me, he no longer has the wherewithal to leave the door of the house. He used to devote himself (wādhāb should be read as wāẓāb) to the Mount of Olives and to God's Temple for as long as he was able and [the strength] was in him, may God reward him."" (Gil's translation diverges significantly from this.) A second theme of the letter is the story of a fellow Toledan, Ibrāhīm b. Fadānj, and his wife, who arrived two years earlier after having been taken captive in Byzantium and redeemed in Ramle. For a detailed analysis of their case—involving multiple changes of allegiance between the Qaraite and Rabbanite communities, and the writer's role in aiding them—see Rustow, ""Karaites Real and Imagined"" (2007), 43–47.","José Martínez Delgado and Amir Ashur, ""A Previously Unpublished Letter of Introduction by an Andalusi Karaite (T-S 8J41.7),"" Miscelánea De Estudios Árabes Y Hebraicos.

This record which was intended for public display, lists the achievements of the qodesh, as far as the properties dedicated to the Synagogue of the Palestinians are concerned. For each stage the names of the parnasim who were in charge of the qodesh are listed. At the end of the 10th century apparently only two or three compounds comprised the real estate dedicated to the Synagogue of the Palestinians. During the seven administrations of parnasim listed in this record, new compounds, apartments, and shops were added either by purchase or by construction, made possible by the revenue from the earlier ones. Several major repairs of the extant buildings and also repairs and improvements in the synagogue are listed. The main part of the document deals with the period of the persecuations under al-Hakim. The synagogues were destroyed and the materials they were made of sold by the Muslim authorities. Later, the period of reconstruction is recorded. The concluding part stresses the custom of giving full publicity to the accounts of the qodesh; also, the duty of any dissatisfied person to file his claims before the court, otherwise risking excommunication. Gil includes ENA 2738.1 as part of this join, even though it is a distinct manuscript containing a draft of the document, of which T-S Ar.18(1).35 + T-S 20.96 is an improved copy. The first word in line 1 of ENA 2738.1 is the last one in line 19 of T-S 20.96. All three fragments are in the hand of hazzan Yefet b. David b. Shekhanya (according to Gil).

In Judaeo-Arabic. Written on vellum in a scholarly hand. The first page of the letter is lost. Dating: 1088/89 CE, or shortly after, based on Goitein's interpretation of the year ""48"" as 4848 AM. The letter picks up with the father explaining his happy situation in Salonica and why he cannot possibly return to Egypt, as his son had asked him to do (r1–19). The writer lives in Salonica with his wife (not the addressee's mother) and a daughter with many suitors. He fears that they would be a burden on the family in Egypt. He is blind and weak—""I have nothing left but my tongue and my heart"" (i.e., mind)—but he has not perished. On the contrary, he is in a thousand states of well-being and is highly regarded by all who fear God. He overhears the Shabbat services from his dwelling. None of the scholars of Salonica are able to match him in his knowledge of the law. He next sends regards to various family members and congratulates his son on the acquisition of noble in-laws (r20–27). He is worried about his family, because he heard that ""in the year 48 the Nile had a low flood, and my heart trembled, and I have no rest, neither by day or by night. For God's sake, write me immediately regarding your well-being"" and about each person's livelihood (r27–32). The son should send his response to ʿImrān b. Naḥum in Alexandria who will forward it to Salonica, to the upper synagogue, to the house of Shabbetay b. Moshe Matakla 'the head' (r33–36). He exhorts his son not to neglect the study of Torah or be distracted by his business affairs (r36–v1). He then recapitulates the reasons for his departure from Egypt 26 years earlier and what has happened in the interim (v1–v21). It seems his motives for traveling were both pious (wishing to bury his bones in Jerusalem) and financial. At first he sent all the money he earned back to his family, and had none with which to travel back himself. He traveled from place to place for 30 months. At that time he learned that a business partner of the family perished in a fire, from which point onward, ""I never had anything but expenses."" The 'Turks' then invaded the Byzantine east, so he fled to the west, ultimately reaching Salonica. His vision weakened, gradually, over the course of five years. In Salonica, he has refrained from granting his daughter to any of her many suitors until he received word from his son and his brother-in-law Abū l-Ḥ̋asan. The writer then returns to the subject of why he cannot possibly travel back to Egypt (v21–v34). Even as his son's letter was read to him, he had no strength to go out his door or leave his house without being supported. He can hardly see or hear. If his son saw him, he would ""flee the distance of a month's journey."" This is apart from the grave danger of the travel itself and his anxiety on account of his old age and his wife—even though she herself would love to travel. It is not in his nature to save money, and he repeats his fear that he would be a burden on the family. There is then a cryptic passage (v30–34) warning his son against listening to 'a generation that left us' and which had various faults that cannot be written in a letter. He concludes (v34–39) with another exhortation to study Torah diligently. When the son was 13 years old, he used to astound people with his intelligence.

Azarya, conflict","Letter from an ardent supporter to Daniel b. ʿAzarya. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Ca. 1055 CE (per Goitein). This is the first leaf of a longer letter. The sender puts his money and his friends at Daniel's disposal. The letter is also an attack on ʿEli b. ʿAmram, who is never directly named. The sender describes communal strife in Fustat after the death of the gaon Shelomo b. Yehuda (d. 1051) and Abū Kathīr Efrayim b. Shemarya (d. after 1053 CE, probably ca. 1055 CE). The other supporters of Daniel b. ʿAzarya wanted to appoint the Rav (=Yehuda b. Yosef) as the successor of Efrayim b. Shemarya, and they did not want ʿEli b. ʿAmram to assume the position. (The Rav was in the camp of Daniel b. ʿAzarya despite being the cousin of his rivals Yosef and Eliyya, the sons of Shelomo ha-Kohen b. Yehosef, who was briefly gaon in 1025 CE.) However, the sender paradoxically thinks that their enemy, ʿEli b. ʿAmram, should succeed Efrayim, precisely because then he will have to pay obeisance to Daniel, and the two camps will be united. The letter's contents are as follows: (1) condolences on the death of Daniel's sister (r1–12); (2) praise and seeking forgiveness for the fight that had had in the house of al-Damsīsī—Goitein understands this to be because the sender had advocated for ʿEli b. ʿAmram, Daniel's enemy (r13–21); (3) ʿEli (""the idiot"") didn't understand that the sender had long been a supporter of Daniel b. ʿAzarya, even before the death of Shelomo b. Yehuda; and anything the sender has done for ʿEli is like what David did for Saul—serving him despite the latter's intention to kill him (r23–36); (4) an explanation of how the sender supported ʿEli b. ʿAmram over the Rav, against the objections of the rest of Daniel's contingent, including Abū Isḥāq (Avraham b. Yiṣḥaq Ibn al-Furāt) (v1–12); (5) ʿEli b. ʿAmram's boorish behavior once he assumed leadership, which alienated the other leading figures of the community (including Abū Sahl al-Kohen, a certain Abū l-Surūr, and a certain Elḥanan), to the point that they boycotted the synagogue  (v12–28); (6) ʿEli, fearing that he would be deposed in favor of the Rav, recruited his son-in-law Ḥunayn and started spreading malicious rumors about the Rav, including something he supposedly said to Ibn al-Talmid involving the latter's mother. Then, ""Ḥunayn went and gathered some potters and quarrelsome people, and hired about fifty of them, and they wrote legal deeds about the Rav, [saying] that he had apostatized (pashaʿa) in al-Shām and [later] arrived in Egypt to re-Judaize (yatahawwada)"" (v29–36). (Information from Goitein's edition. Translation of the last section from Moshe Yagur, ""Several Documents from the Cairo Geniza Concerning Conversion to Islam"" (2020).) (Alan Elbaum) The handwriting on this letter is the same as that of ENA 4020.65, a copy of what Goitein believed to be a petition from Shelomo b. Yehuda to al-Ẓāhir during the rivalry with Yosef al-Sijilmāsī.

Khalaf (?), probably in Minyat Ghamr, writes to his cousin (ibn ʿamma), Eliyyahu the Judge, in Fustat. These cousins had prior correspondence and business dealings—Eliyyahu sent 22 dirhams with his previous letter, and the writer has a store in which he deals in indigo. The purpose of this letter is to ask Eliyyahu to write to the judge R. Menaḥem in the hope of obtaining permission for Abū l-Faraj to take a second wife. Eliyyahu is familiar with the case already, but Abū l-Faraj repeats some of it here. He has endured 20 years of suffering because of the illness of his wife, which prevents her from going to the bath (presumably a problem for him because of menstrual purity laws rather than because of hygiene). When Abū l-Faraj arrived in Minyat Ghamr from Jerusalem, he found a second woman whom he wanted to marry. The local judge, Mufaḍḍal the ḥaver, refused to marry them on his own authority and said that permission would need to come from higher up. Mufaḍḍal sent a letter to R. Menaḥem with Ḥabīb the shohet, but there was no response; Abū l-Faraj himself was unable to accompany Ḥabīb. Abū l-Faraj thought that Eliyyahu would already have intervened on his behalf, but no news of that has reached him. He visited Alexandria, but it seems that Mufaḍḍal discouraged him from seeking a ruling from the judge [A]natoli on account of his strictness. In the remainder of the letter, he repeats his request in various ways. He is willing to come to Fustat in order to marry. Information from Friedman's edition and translation. The writer quotes a saying in lines v13–15, where he is urging Eliyyahu to act quickly, and Friedman marked his translation as somewhat tentative. Cf. alternate versions of the same idiom in ENA 2558.21, T-S 13J21.20, Moss. II,167, T-S Misc.28.33, and Bodl. MS heb. d 66/14, e.g., ""mā baqiya fī l-ʿumr mithla mā maḍā,"" literally, ""there do not remain [years] of life like those which have passed,"" apparently corresponding to the English ""we aren't getting any younger, [so please help me]."" Another version of the phrase also appears in the first chapter of Ibn Buṭlān's Daʿwat al-Aṭibbā', in the mouth of a physician whose income has dried up and who has nowhere to go: mā baqiya aqallu mimmā maḍā (""what remains is less than what has passed"").

Regarding a woman in Alexandria with a sick daughter, whose husband had fled his creditor and gone to the capital. The letter says that she had been deserted for a long time, that she had to maintain herself and her little girl, to pay rent, and on top of this, was sued in court by the creditor of her husband. The writers of the letter ask in the politest terms that Shemuel approach the Nagid for action in this matter. Verso: Letter from the judge Shemuel to the Nagid. The writer reports that he had sent several summons to the runaway husband, but since both the High Holidays (approx. September) and Hanukka (approx. December) had passed without response from him, sterner measures were now required, and, to the judge's dismay, the Nagid had to be troubled. The matter was of utmost seriousness since the Alexandrian wife asserted that her husband had married another woman and was living with her in Cairo. Clearly, the police now had to be instructed to bring the man to court by force. But only the Nagid, as official representative of the state, was authorized to give that order.

Shemuel, waqf, qodesh, 12th c, heqdesh, acccount","Legal document (written by Yosef b. Shemuel. AA) . Lease of an apartment of the Qodesh ca. 1194 and 1199. A deed of lease is concluded between the qodesh and a certain Abu'l-Surur. The deed is written in the name of the court, by a scribe whose handwriting we know from other documents of the qodesh of this period. It is validated by Shemuel b. Saadya. Abu'l-Surur was apparently in the perfume business, and the representatives of the qodesh wished to prevent the qa'a rented by him from being used for anything connected with his occupation. He is therefore absolutely forbidden to arrange for any reservoir of rose water, or to make any breach in the wall, or to use arsenic or any other drugs whose production entails the use of fire. The verso of the document, written five years later by Shemuel b. Saadya, lists a series of payments collected by him from the same Abu'l-Surur, on account of another period of lease during which he occupied the same qa'a. Some of the payments are made indirectly through a third party.

Dating: Early twelfth century (see explanation below). The writer asks the addressee to send her money for two orphan sisters whose care she was reluctantly supervising. The girls were ten and thirteen years old and had no relatives to take care of them, and nothing to live on. They had been allotted two dinars from communal charity funds, but for some reason (the letter is torn here, and parts are missing) the money had not actually been sent; without it, they had ""only enough for a crust of bread."" A childless widow who lived nearby had volunteered to teach them embroidery, and the letter's narrator was willing to check in on them once in a while. But she refused to take them into her household, even though the girls themselves wanted her to: ""They constantly tell me, 'We want to come to you so that you can take care of us.' She asked the Head of the Jews instead to provide the two dinars that the girls had been promised, along with extra funds to rent them a living space and to hire a religious teacher who could ""teach them prayer, so they will not grow up like animals, not knowing shemaʿ yisra'el.""

Abū l-Khayr al-ʿAkkāwī, Fustat, from his uncle (khāl) Ṣadoq b. Namir he-Ḥaver, Tiberias. ""The imprisonment (and torture) of defaulting debtors was common practice. The letter here tells about the imprisonment of the wives and children of absconding debtors, who owed money to Eschiva (Echive), the countess of Tiberias and wife of the renowned Raymond III of Tripoli. One wonders for what services Jews could owe considerable sums to the countess so that they had to flee to Egypt in order to try to collect there funds for repayment. The most likely assumption is that the services were the same as those found so often as a source of disaster in the relations with the Muslim government, namely: tax farming, see Med Soc II, 361–63. Raymond, who is referred to in this letter, returned from Muslim captivity in 1173/74, and Eschiva remained ruler over Tiberias until it was taken by Saladin in 1187. Thus the letter must have been written sometime in between these two dates."" Goitein, Nachlass material.

Ashtor interpreted it incorrectly as (5)164 (AM) = 1404 CE (History of the Jews in Egypt and Syria under the Mamluks, vol. 3, p. 100 n. 2). Goitein corrected Ashtor's reading to 1204 because, as with many other 13th century documents in the geniza, you have to add 4800 to the stated date, so 4964 AM = 1204. To write 4964 in Hebrew, you would have to use a lot of characters, since the alef-bet only covers up until 400. So 4964 would be דתתקסד (that is, 4(000) + 400 + 400 + 100 + 60 + 4). But since in 1204, everyone knew the 4000 + 400 + 400 part, they just omitted it and wrote 164. So the document dates to 1204.

Mūsā al-Māyurkī (""from Mallorca"") and another Ibrahīm b. Mūsā, whose origin isn't preserved in the text. Both would contribute both financial capital and labor. Funds are brought out into a single purse, suggesting that the act of qinyan effected the partnership. Both partners are to engage in trade. The division of profit and loss is not preserved, but line 10 hints that profits and losses were to be divided equally between the two partners. Line 11 affirms the partners' mandate to ""avoid betrayal and indolence and neglect"", suggesting this may have been a long-distance trading partnership. The partners promise ""ethical and honorable"", perhaps because certain norms of behavior are expected of the partners. This does not release the partners from the ""oath of partners"", though, so legal recourse for misappropriation or negligence remains possible.

The total revenue from these apartments, for two months, is 372.25 dirhams. There are two different categories of expenditures; a) the usual items whose purpose is specified, and b) major sums deposited with the parnas himself, and a certain Abu'l-Makhasin, apparently the beadle of the Synagogue of the Babylonians. Whereas the revenue total accords with the sum of the items listed, there is no way to check the total of the expenditures; apparently only some of the operations are noted on this sheet.

Recto: Statement about the debt of a parnas. Dating: ca. 1151 CE. The parnas Abū Saʿīd b. Ḥātim was in charge of collecting 118 dirhams rent monthly from the ""estate of the Jerusalemites."" He also was in charge of collecting 110 dirhams per month from a place whose name is lost. The document seems to be a ḥawāla from this parnas to another parnas Abū l-Khayr al-Ṣayrafi. Three members of the court (Yaʿaqov b. Avraham, Efrayim b. Meshullam, and Natan b. Shemuel) sign it, apparently after the sum was cashed in. (Information from Gil, Documents, pp. 264 #51) 

Verso, upper part: A second statement, written on the verso of the previous statement, apparently to update the financial relationship between the same parnas and the qodesh, confirms a debt owed to him by the qodesh. The upper part confirms 209.75 dirhams due to him for repairs in the estate of the Jerusalemites, and 230 dirhams for a banker's note (suftaja?). 

Verso, lower part: A declaration by another elder, Yosef, that the sum mentioned was spent for repairs with the exception of 13 dirhams for removal of garbage. Abū l-Barakāt b. Sahl is mentioned. Both parts are signed by members of the court. (Information mainly from Gil, Documents, pp. 265 #52)","Moshe Gil, Documents of the Jewish Pious Foundations from the Cairo Geniza (1976). ; S. D.

Mišaʾel have become void; and if they are void for him, why should not the other leases and deeds of rent of ruined lots be discontinued as well. The complaint was probably submitted in 1171 or somewhat later and it emerges that the agreement made with Isaiah stipulated that the plaintiff was to rebuild a ruin of the qodesh and live in it until his investment in repairs was balanced out by a hypothetical rent, in the meantime paying only the ground rent (ḥikr) to the government. Maimonides was apparently opposed to this agreement, possibly because of legal principles regarding permission to make deals with properties of the qodesh. In the second part of the letter, the writer requests Maimonides to answer various questions on the study of the Law which he had previously asked him, and to which he now adds a question on the attitude to astronomy. He also asks him for some of his books, to be copied for him, the cost to be paid from the money due to him, if the debt is recognized.

In Judaeo-Arabic. The writer calls the addressee 'my uncle' (ʿammī). The purpose of this letter is to break off their relationship, and it is striking for its hostility. The writer reports that Abū Isḥāq the cantor recently arrived and told him that the addressee is seriously ill (fī ḥālin ṣaʿb min al-wajaʿ). In place of expressing sympathy, the writer begins a tirade about how the addressee has mistreated him (and/or his family members?) and wounded his heart; ""even strangers could not wound my heart so"" (r13–14). The substance of the conflict is difficult to discern. The writer expresses the wish that certain people will be killed by marauding Ghuzz (Seljuks/Turkomans) (r7–8). The writer continues, ""May God curse the hour that unearthed this matter. . . it has brought me nothing but evil (wabāl).

Although the address reads ""from your son Yosef,"" the letter is written in the voice of an older woman who defends herself against the addressee's blame for not looking after Yosef properly and for not marrying him to her own daughter. The writer describes a form of temporary marriage that Yosef contracted with an orphan girl. “He fell ill (maraḍa), and his illnss intensified (ishtadda wajʿuhu), and he had no one to attend to him. Thus he saw fit to take a young orphan girl to attend to him, and he married her on the condition that if he wished to be free to move back to his country, he would write her a bill of divorce.” The letter further reports that the wife gave birth to a boy who died. The writer adds that she herself was sick during these events (and thus could hardly be blamed for not intervening).

Nissim, trade, 11th c","Letter from Marduk b. Musa from Alexandria to Nahray b. Nissim, Fustat. In the handwriting of Avraham b. Faraḥ. Dated 5 Elul, early or mid-August. Reports on the sailing of ships from al-Mahdiyya heading eastward, which must have been among the last departures for the east, since the sailing season ended in mid-September. The letter mentions that the ships that left al-Mahdiyya before the qārib of al-Mufaḍḍal al-Ḥayfī had not yet arrived in Alexandria, either because they were different vessels and travelled at a different speed, or because they took a different course and encountered different weather and wind. The letter mentions three members of the al-Tāhartī family who also travelled in a qārib, that of Ibn al-Manajjā, which left before that of al-Mufaḍḍal al-Hayfī but had not yet arrived. Four members of the al-Tāhartī family were making the journey from al-Mahdiyya to Alexandria in one summer and in ships in the same convoy of ships, which suggests some major, joint, coordinated ventures.

In Judaeo-Arabic. Fragment: Bottom half only. Dating: There are reports of men seized for forced labor to dig a ditch around the city. Goitein and Frenkel both suggest that this reference can date the document to 1219 CE, during the fifth crusade. The crusaders besieged Damietta from May 1218 until November 1219 when they finally took it. Evidently, people feared that Alexandria would be next. (See also T-S 16.286, a letter from Alexandria dated 21 October 1219.) This letter reports on the state of the city: ""The city is in a dire state because of the digging of the ditch. The city is locked up, and forced labor is imposed upon the population."" The writer then gives a detailed report about the medical condition and treatment of a woman who had been injured in an unrelated accident, then discusses some small errands, then an important family affair, and concludes with greetings to at least fifteen persons. Two postscripts are added. ""As to Abū l-ʿAlā'—when I arrived, I found the city locked up; no male person could appear in the streets, because he would be taken to the [digging of the] ditch. That's why I was unable to meet him. As to the malḥafa [a blanket serving also as outer garment], the bazaars are locked and no one sells and buys. I am telling you this that you should not think that I am neglectful of your affairs."" Regarding the injury of Yumn: ""When coming home, I found Yumn—on whom the door fell—in a serious condition. She has been ill for forty days. At the time she was impure and remained in that state; thus all the other members of the household became impure together with her. Only God knows how the situation is; she cries so much that I forget my own tribulations. However, if God wills, she has good prospect for recovery. Her leg is in a case (tābūt) especially made for her. A Christian doctor (ʿarel) treats her and I was told that he did not take any money for her treatment. He at that time was treating the wounded (al-majārīḥ). I did not find any bandage (or plaster/dressing) of palm fibers (marham al-nakhlī) in the house and could not move her; for she cannot get up or sit; she bends forward only a little (qad ittajaha qalīl). Her foot and leg are swollen (manfūkh)."" Information and translations from Goitein, Med Soc, V, 56, and note cards #27138–39. This date-palm plaster is recommended for treating wounds and abscesses in the medieval medical literature—a Google search of مرهم نخلي will lead to citations in works by the Andalusians Aḥmad b. ʿIsā al-Hāshimī (d. 1077) and Ibn Zuhr (d. 1162). For Ibn Zuhr, its consistency is like that of honey, and threads are dipped in it before being used to wick fluid out of a wound. Thus, perhaps it is a substance deriving from the date itself, rather than from the palm-fibers. The solution might also be found in Yevr.-Arab. I 1700.22, recto, text block c (PGPID 2724), which may be a recipe for מרהם נכלי. Note also that ""ittajaha"" in the context of injury or illness most often means ""improved"" (rather than ""bend""), and sick people are often described as ""having improved a little"" even if they are still in critical condition. The hand of the letter resembles that of T-S 16.272, written by an Alexandrian judge. ASE.","S. D. Goitein, index cards. ; S. D.

This is not an exhaustive accounting of what's in the letter; also mentioned are the ship of al-Muʿizz, which was carrying the son of Abū Yūsuf, who perished, may God have mercy on him. There were other deaths, and still other people about whom the writer doesn't know whether or not they were saved. Goitein on this pair of letters (Med. Soc., 1:331) ""What could happen to such a convoy is vividly described in two complementary letters, written in Alexandria around the middle of the eleventh century. Altogether, twenty-two ships are mentioned by name and the fate of each is recorded. In addition, the names of the business friends of the addressee, a total of twenty-five, traveling in them and what happened to each are reported. The convoy set sail in three successive groups, called 'sailings' (iqlāʿāt), the first two consisting of eight bottoms each. The first group consisted of a qunbār and a barge of the amir, or governor, of Alexandria; three other barges, one belonging to a vizier, two khīṭīs, one entitled ""al-Ra'isa,"" ""the Chief,"" owned by a lady [Gil reads this differently above, and Rustow concurs with him], and a craft called markab, the general word for ship. The second group consisted of the ship of the sultan Muʿizz of Tunisia, a ship and a barge belonging to a man from Seville, Spain, and several other craft among them one qunbar (as in the first group). These ships sailed on Monday before Pentecost (month of May), but two days later were overcome by a storm, in which the ship of the sultan and another boat perished; the writer of our letters and the addressee both had goods and friends in those ships. The convoy took refuge in two anchoring places on the North African coast, one of which, (Ra's) al-Kanāʾis, is frequently mentioned in our records and is still operating today as a local harbor. (The late King Faruk had a summer palace there, and since Ra's al-Kanaʾis means 'Cape of the Churches,' he renamed it Ra's al-Ḥikma, 'Cape of Wisdom.') Only five ships belonging to the first group succeeded in passing out into the high seas, for in addition to the storm just mentioned, there was another calamity. The enemy, certainly the Byzantine navy, 'which had complete mastery over the sea,' captured one boat and only because of its being busy with it did the rest of the convoy escape. The remaining ships had to return to Alexandria, however, where the governor ordered them to be unloaded, obviously because he did not see any possibility of sending out a second convoy.""","Moshe Gil, In the Kingdom of Ishmael‎ (in Hebrew) (1997), vol. 3. ; S.

The second brother was Maṣliaḥ b. Yefet known as ha-Gizbar (""the Treasurer""), i.e., he was a government officer. (This Maṣliaḥ is also known from Megillat Evyatar as the man who brought up David b. Daniel b. ʿAzarya.) There were two tyrannical governors in Damascus: Ḥaydara Ibn Manzū (r.1063–64) and Muʿallā Ibn Manzū (r.1068–69). One of these expropriated the property of Maṣliaḥ in the Dār Quzmān neighborhood (near the eastern gate of Damascus, in the Jewish quarter), and the two brothers Maṣliaḥ and ʿUthmān fled the city for Egypt. Some 25 years later, Yefet the son of Maṣliaḥ returned to his birthplace and sued to regain the property abandoned by his father and uncle. In the meantime, another uncle had moved into one of the houses, encroaching beyond the border of the neighboring property owned by his wife. The uncle insisted on bringing the case to the Muslim courts, and Yefet b. Maṣliaḥ here testifies that he was compelled to go to the Muslim courts and did not want to.

Court record (copy). This document concerns the settlement of an account between Abū al-Mufaḍḍal Netanel b. Yefet and Abū al-Ḥasan Ṭoviyya b. Avraham ha-Levi. Netanel brought a court-validated document specifying that  Ṭoviyya owed him 65 dinars. Ṭoviyya claimed that he sent the amount in various commodities (15 pounds of silk worth 15 dirhams, and fragrances worth 15 dinars, in addition to kābulī murabbā (preserve of chebulic myrobalan), as well as 10 dinars in cash) by means of the agent Abū al-Faraj to be sold in Tunisia. It is unclear whether the 65 dinars is a partnership account or a debt owed Netanel by Ṭoviyya. However, that the commodities were sent to be sold in Tunisia (see T-S 8J4.9) suggests that Ṭoviyya has a financial interest in the sale. Depositing the funds with Abū al-Faraj, Netanel and Ṭoviyya have contracted a partnership of sorts for repayment of Ṭoviyya's debt. Lieberman speculates that the Abū al-Faraj al-Wakīl mentioned here may have been Abū al-Faraj Yeshu‘a b.

Tthe scribal notes were likely composed quickly, with the intention of subsequently filling in these details when the fuller agreement was written. The amount of the partners’ investment is specified only for Abū Sa‘d b. Ibrahīm al-Ṣabbāgh, who lays out 82 and 11/12ths dinars. Prior to departure, Abū Sa‘d fell ill and was unable to travel. Generally, this situation might require the ill (active) partner to be demoted to an investor; the division of profits here may reflect such a restructuring. The three active partners are allocated 13/24ths of profits while Abū Sa‘d is allocated 11/24ths, while losses are split evenly. The additional twelfth of the profit is allocated to the partners as ""wages for their work and maintenance"". Separately, Abū Sa‘d places 19 dinars in a commenda with Suleyman b. ‘Imrān with a similar division of profits and losses. It is unclear why Abū Sa‘d places the bulk of his investment with the three partners and then an additional investment with only Suleyman.

The apartment is in Dar al-Zajjaj, one of the compounds owned by the qodesh. The lessee is himself a parnas. The tabaqa is described as the apartment, sukn, of Makarim Ibn Sahlan. In fact, this must be understood as Makarim and Ibn Sahlan, since they are listed separately in accounts of rent, where they pay five dirhams a month each, the same sum of rent that Abu'l-Fadl, the new tenant, will have to pay. Abu'l-Bayan, the representative of the qodesh, cannot be one of the parties in the concluding formula which says ""from each of the two,"" since he represents the court. The most plausible explanation is that the two tenants rented the tabaqa of the qodesh inhabited by them, to a third party, with the knowlesge and active participation of the qodesh.

Of the ships that had been in al-Kanāʾis (a port in western Egypt), the only ones that had made it all the way to Alexandria were 7 ships of al-Ishfīlī, and one qārib apiece of Ibn Dayṣūr, Ibn Sindūr, Ibn al-Dajdāj, Ibn al-Jannānī and al-Jazūla — 12 in all. An unnamed enemy stopped one ship, and the others fled; and only 5 ships managed to set out on their way. Gil connects this with the 15 ships mentioned in T-S 8J27.2, his #447, and therefore understands this letter to imply that the ship of Ibn al-Baʿbāʿ was among those that hadn't yet returned to Alexandria). Musa is preparing to go to Palestine; he asks Nahray for a letter of recommendation (this part translated in Udovitch, ""Formalism and Informalism""). Also mentions the fayj, and a tax receipt for the khums related to a consignment of raisins. (Information from Gil, Kingdom, vol. 3, #448, and from ibid., vol. 1, sec. 315, fn) There is a companion letter to this one, T-S 8J27.2 (PGPID 2084); see there for further details of the same events.","Moshe Gil, In the Kingdom of Ishmael‎ (in Hebrew) (1997), vol. 3. ; S.

Settlement of a dispute of two partners in a bakery concerning the repayment of depleted partnership capital. The creditor, Abū l-Riḍā ha-Shomer (the guard), loaned funds to the partnership as a corporation but not to the partners as individuals. Although the two partners contracted to work the same amount and to share profits and losses equally, the partnership lacks sufficient funds to repay the loan. Abū l-Riḍā asks the partners to demand the “oath of partners” each from the other, and himself demands that each pay half the loss, but one of the partners (Hiba) seems reluctant for unclear reasons. Pressured by Hiba's refusal to pay his share of the debt, the other partner (Mūsā b. Bishr, who appears also in ENA 4011.55) brings Hiba to court. The result of the court’s action was mediation (“tawassaṭū”), and Hiba agreed to pay Mūsā a single dinar, to which the latter would add the balance of three dinars. The initial loan amount and the repayment amount were both four dinars, and that it seems that Abū al-Riḍā did expect to garner profit from the loan directly. Signed by Natan b. Shelomo ha-Kohen.

Abū al-Faraj is referred to as ""his teacher"", though his trade is not clear from the document; he is simply called ""the [government] employee"". This and the fact that Hillel indentures himself to Abū al-Faraj with the loan, suggests an apprenticeship relationship, though the nature of the work itself is unclear.

Levi ha-Levi, in Qalyūb. (Identification is tentative, based on handwriting and typical phrases and names.) Someone, possibly ʿImrān (but not their paternal uncle of the same name), recently died in or around the addressee's location. The 'kabīra' (old woman?) has arrived back safely. Abū Zikrī (=Sar Shalom??) is making a big fuss and swearing that he saw Moshe in Cairo on Wednesday with two baskets of apricots. Yedutun complains about how everyone repays him with ingratitude, and he seems to refer to his activities as a physician (although Goitein read יטבהם in line 9 as יכצהם). Yedutun had to swear to Abū Zikrī that he must have been mistaken about seeing Moshe in Cairo and that Moshe doesn't know Ben Shaʿya either. Abū Zikrī apparently gave an exceedingly long sermon (דראש) on Shabbat. Tāhir is asking about Moshe's news and wants him to know that the new wālī is a relative of the old wālī, and he will take revenge on people who defy him (or defied his predecessor?), so Moshe should watch out. Moshe should also pass on Yedutun's prescription to Yaḥyā al-Khuḍarī, because Yedutun owes him a favor. He is very sad about ʿImrān and can't even eat bread (a standard phrase to express grief). He asks Moshe to pass on condolencees to ʿImrān's brother. And if Moshe wants the family to come visit him at the end of the month, he should let them know with a day's notice.

Half the capital (20 dinars in total) invested by Abū Sa‘d is considered a loan to Abū Sahl, who pledges title to his home as a security. This may suggest diversion from the commenda model, where the active partner is not liable for loss. But the partnership also diverges from the ‘eseq model, wherein only the active partner transacts. Both the profit/loss characteristics and the working arrangement between the partners suggests a craft partnership.

Abū Sa‘d is likely the senior partner: he is identified as al-Zajjāj, “the glazier” (i.e., a known personage in the field), while Abū Sahl is given no professional designation; as well, Abū Sa‘d invests all of the capital, suggesting that he may be short of liquid assets). Finally, the partnership stipulates that Abū Sa‘d need only work two shifts a week (suggesting he may have other business elsewhere), while Abū Sahl will work the rest of the week. 

Maṣliaḥ ha-Kohen, mentioned in line 54, functioned as leader of the Jewish community of Fusṭāṭ from 1127 to 1139.

The writer sends thanks for the forwarding of a prescription from one physician, Abū l-Bahā', and reminds Natan to obtain a second prescription from another physician, al-Amīn, both for his sick wife. The latter physician was perhaps a Muslim or Christian, since the addressee is asked to transcribe the prescription from Arabic to Hebrew (but cf. T-S 8J16.19 + T-S NS 323.13, in which a Jew is asked not to use Arabic script). ""Favor your servant with the answer to be given by my lord al-Amīn, may his reward be doubled. Please transcribe for me the prescription into Hebrew letters."") As requested, Ṭoviya provides an elaborate update on the condition of his sick wife: ""She has six attacks (fawra) during the day and four during the night. Perspiration (ʿaraq) overcomes her from the sockets of her eyes (maḥājīr ʿaynayhā) to her chest (fu'ādhā). Owing to the high fever (min ʿuẓm al-nār) she has a feeling that her neck first burns (iḥtaraqat) and then becomes cold (yabrud). At the same time, she suffers pain in her knees (wajaʿ rukab). Owing to her grave sufferings (min ʿuẓm al-alam) her menses (al-ṭamth) have stopped. Finally, because of her great anxiety (min kuthrat al-takarrub), she is affected by mild palpitation (rajīf yasīr) of the heart.""

The letter was dictated to Ibrāhīm (the writer's father?) and addressed to Abū l-Ḥasan b. Ibrāhīm al-Ṣā'igh in the market of the goldsmiths in Fusṭāṭ. The first part of the letter is a rebuke for the addressee's silence. ""We could all die, and still you would not ask after us. We hear news of you only from hearsay. If it were not for my pregnancy, I would have traveled [to Fusṭāṭ] to ask after you, because I am tired of sending letters without receiving responses. You now write to tell me, 'Come to us,' because my maternal aunt has died. You did not even write to tell me that you were sick [as well]. Even if I were your enemy, that much at least you would owe me. My cousin died, and you did not even write to console me or your paternal uncle. . . What is the solution to (or reason for?) this enmity? Please come and visit, for the house is derelict and empty. We fear the billeting—for the ṣāḥib al-dīwān lives next door in the house of Yūsuf and walks over the roofs—and that the Ghuzz will take it, and we will not be able to say anything. Even Ibn al-Sarūjī sold his house because of the Ghuzz."" On verso: ""By God, my sister, console the daughter of my maternal aunt on my behalf. I was sick and was unable to write to her to console her about her mother. As soon as you see this letter, send its response and whatever you see fit with whomever will deliver it. I will pay for it. All of my children have fallen sick, and the female slave is also sick, may God make the end good. By God, I do not need to urge you to send the response quickly, for my eyes are on the road and on every person who arrives. When I hear you are healthy, I will rejoice. I have taken a vow not to break my fast during the day until your letter arrives. I have perished from fasting. Perhaps you will come in place of your letter, and look into what you will do with your [share in the house?]. For Ibn Hilāl is not waiting for Ibn al-Qāḍī to arrive.

Mūsā of Sfax, in Mazar, Sicily, to his partner Yehuda b. Moshe b. Sughmār, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic. The longest letter in the Geniza. Dating: Early 1060s according to Ben-Sasson, based on the military disruptions mentioned. 7 September 1064 according to Gil, based on his identification of the battle discussed as that between the Qā'id of Sfax and the Zīrid ruler Tamīm b. Muʿizz on that date. Many details about a wide variety of commodities are mentioned, as well as financial transactions. ""In essence, this long letter had a single purpose: to convince Yehuda b. Sughmār, Salāma's partner, not to dissolve the relationship between them."" Salāma in fact agrees to the dissolution of the formal partnership (ṣuḥba), ""I got your letters this year, and you swore that you wanted to dissolve. I want this to happen even more than you do. If the partnership continues there will be discord. . . . Now we no longer feel as we used to, when we relied on each other"" (v4–5, 30). Despite this, Salāma suggests other ways of continuing their relationship, including Yehuda's mentoring of Nissim, a new junior associate Salāma is sending to him, and Yehuda's sending Salāma some goods in agency. Jessica Goldberg, Trade and Institutions, pp. 296–99 (""Salāma b. Mūsā's Disastrous Year""). Salāma opens with his shock and dismay at the letters full of blame that he had received from Yehuda. ""I had expected you to congratulate me on my survival in al-Mahdiyya, my deliverance from destruction, and the terrible ordeal (al-mawqif al-ʿaẓīm, also mentioned in r23) that I would not wish on anyone. I was bound (kutiftu) and almost killed (or executed, ʿuriḍtu ʿalā l-sayf) four times (or five—the ink is flaked here). Even if there were no partnership (sharika), love, (mawadda), or association (ṣuḥba) between us, this would have been incumbent on you. Now, more than one year later, the terror has not subsided, rather the fright remains in my heart. My greatest trial in al-Mahdiyya was my concern for your business. . . ."" Interestingly, when Salāma mentions Yehuda's illnesses of last year (mā laḥaqak tilk al-sana min al-ḍuʿf wa-l-tawajjuʿ, r75), there is not a word of the usual sympathy or congratulations on his recovery. Gil understands Halper 414 to be a follow-up from this letter; Goldberg believes that Halper 414, a small sheet, was inserted into Halper 389, which seems to agree with Goitein, who calls it a ""continuation"" of Halper 389 (see Goitein notes linked to PGPID 35364).

Abu Sahl's dependents include an old woman and a sick man who cannot sleep day or night. Abu Sahl has had to buy oil instead of bread, ""so that he does not die in darkness."" Abu Sahl himself has been ill for the last month. He turned to al-Shaykh al-Nezer, who told him that Sayyidnā ordered for him to receive bread in the distribution, but it has been three weeks and he has not received any bread.

Partnership agreement. Dated: 1248-1249. Location: Fustat. This document describes a partnership in a sugar-factory. It's likely the document is a draft because it lacks the signatures of witnesses, and because it uses “So-and-So” (""Pl[oni] ben Pl[oni]"") in place of the partners’ names throughout. However, the level of detail which is included suggests that this was not simply the page out of a formulary work. The partnership may have been an apprenticeship since only one of the partners is described as bringing assets to the partnership, the distribution of profits is not even between the partners but rather grants one partner two-thirds of the profit despite the fact that both partners are active in trading, and the partnership itself is to last “a number of years”. Lines 14-15 read “And if So-and-So requests [this] of us, we will affix our signature”, suggesting that perhaps sometimes partnership agreements were formed without witnesse.

Yakhin), in Fustat, to his brother Abū l-Najm Hilāl, presumably in Alexandria. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Early 13th century. Hilāl had recently departed from a brief visit after a prolonged absence (""being away for 10 years and visiting Fustat for 3 days—a person would not believe it""). Abu l-Majd fell sick with unnamed illnesses after his departure. Probably based on a low quality image, Goitein read the margin as stating that he was unable to go down to the synagogue to lead the congregation in the prayer for their sick sister because he himself was not well (Med Soc, V, 537). However, the final letter of the word that Goitein read as דעא cannot be an aleph, and the first letter is closer to Abu l-Majd's distinctive כ than his ד. The best fit may be אלכפץ. Moreover, the word לאכתי fits the context better if it is read לאנני. Thus, a more likely reading seems to be, ""I was delayed in going down below (to see you off) because I was unwell...."" On verso, Abu l-Majd continues, ""...[I went] after you to the water, and I searched the boats and could not find you—it was like you had flown away. By God, by God, send me a healing letter and tell me when you arrived, and how your arrival was, and tell me all of your news."" He also asks his brother to inform the teacher Abū l-Futūḥ (Yehuda b. al-ʿAmmānī) that Abu l-Majd sent him the selihot, a letter, and a fatwa, and he wishes to know if they were received.

2728,https://geniza.princeton.edu/documents/2728/,,,Yevr.-Arab. I 1701,,,,Legal document,"register, Qaraites, to edit, adultery, rashomon, harassment","Legal report in a Qaraite court register. Written in Judaeo-Arabic. Location: Cairo. Dating: Unknown. Catalogued as 1101 CE, but this date does not appear on the microfilm images. Perhaps the missing digits were legible in the past or remain legible on the physical document. The date in the microfilm reads ""Sunday night, 7 Tevet, 14[..] Seleucid."" The digits את appear at the beginning of the year, but this gives only an earliest possible date of 1089 CE and a latest possible date of 1688 CE. Based solely on the script, a date in the 13th century seems more likely. The scribe has the unusual name Neḥam'el b. Mevorakh b. Yehuda b. Aharon. The document is a fascinating report on the Qaraite court of Cairo's investigation into the years-long rumors about the relationship between Abū Naṣr b. Qayūma and an unnamed woman who is alternately referred to as ""the daughter of Abū l-Maʿālī b. Tāmār,"" ""the wife of Abū Saʿd b. Ṣadaqa al-Labbān,"" and ""the woman."" It appears that the woman had a petition (ruqʿa) written on her behalf to the communal authorities, which came into the possession of the scribe, who subsequently brought it to the attention of the Qaraite authority, ha-Nasi ha-Gadol, who called for an inquiry. The council first summoned the woman and her husband (called her ""waliyy"" or ""guardian""). (1) She reported that Abū Naṣr had been stalking her for years, visiting her house three or four times a day. She was frightened of him and told her husband's paternal aunt that if she ever saw Abū Naṣr visit when this woman was alone, she should come down and join them. She had gone several times to the court to complain about him, but nothing came of that. When asked whether she knew who wrote the petition (ruqʿa), she admitted that in fact she was the one responsible for it, but the person who wrote it for her added some things she had not said and left out other things she had said. (2) As for the husband, he responded that he didn't know anything about this. All he knew was that his wife hated to have Abū Naṣr in their house, but he never knew why. (3) Abū Nāsr was then summoned. He denied everything. But then he admitted that he had previously been summoned to court and been issued a restraining order not to enter her house for a period of a year and a half. They questioned him repeatedly, but he wouldn't admit anything else. (4) The woman was then questioned in Abū Naṣr's presence what she had said in his absence, and she was unwilling to repeat what she said before. Rather, ""she changed her story. . . and said, 'I hated. . .'"" (5) Abū l-Faraj al-Ṭaḥḥān reported to the court and attested that whenever he visited the house of his brother-in-law Abū Saʿd b. Ṣadaqa al-Labbān and Abū Naṣr b. Qayūma was also present, he witnessed Abū Naṣr's vulgar speech and behavior toward the woman, but he had no knowledge of whether anything else passed between them. (6) A number of other women were then questioned. They confirmed that the woman under investigation had complained to them numerous times about Abū Naṣr's harassment (taʿarruḍ) of her. However, the scribe writes, because their testimony entirely derived from what the woman herself told them, there is no need to record it in this document. But he notes that these women confirmed her ""agitation"" (imtiʿāḍ) whenever she talked about Abū Naṣr's behavior to them. At this point the court determined that they needed to gather more testimony. Thus they agreed that the next day a ban of excommunication would be declared against anyone who had knowledge of the affair and did not come forward to testify about it. The scribe records the date and his name, and several witnesses sign: Netan'el ha-Kohen b. ʿAmram; Yefet ha-Melammed b. Ḥalfon(?), Avraham b. Yefet, and probably others that are now faded. He adds an addendum the following day stating that he attended ""al-majliṣ al-marsūm"" (Goitein interprets this as 'the next prayer service') of the Qaraites in Cairo and declared the agreed-upon ban of excommunication, effective for a period of one week. This addendum was witnessed by Avraham b. Yefet and Yefet ha-Melammed b. Ḥalfon(?). This document is mentioned several times in Zinger's dissertation and in Goitein, Med Soc V, 314 and 592. ASE.","S.

Losses are to be split evenly; as the active partner, Avraham is entitled to a larger share of the profits than that for which he would be liable in terms of losses, per Maimonidean criteria (even though the difference between Avraham’s share in the profit and his share in the loss is only 1/24 of the total profit). Per Maimonides, the partners have the flexibility to create such a profit and loss sharing agreement only if they have multiple concurrent business relationships; otherwise the percentage of profits allocated to the active partner must exceed the percentage of losses by at least 1/6 of the total profit, in which case Avraham would have been allocated no less than 2/3 of the profit (since he is to share losses equally with Seʿadya).

Abū l-ʿAlā al-Ṣabbāgh in an apothecary shop. Moshe is paid 6 dirhams a month agrees to work for a year and a half. His wage is guaranteed by Abū Saʿd’s father Abū l-ʿAlāʾ (ll.7-8). Because of the guarantee of Abū al-ʿAlāʾ, three qinyanim are performed: Moshe's agreement to work, Abū Saʿd’s agreement to pay, and the guarantee of Abū l-ʿAlāʾ’. Although the parties’ relationship is described as a partnership, Moshe's wages being fixed suggests an employment agreement, though likely not an apprenticeship, both because Moshe is not a youth (line 5 alludes to his five sons) and is said to manage or set up the store. The date and signatures are missing from the document in its current state of preservation, though T-S NS J405 (PGPID 26473) reveals Abū Saʿd agreeing to repay a debt of some eight hundred dirhams from November 1275. Perhaps Abū Saʿd had come upon difficult times and needed the guarantee of his father in order to convince Moshe to manage the apothecary shop. Note: Abū al-ʿAlāʾ's guarantee is for fulfillment of the obligation “to the store”, suggesting a sense of corporate identity ascribed to the store and its creditors.

Shemuel then conveys the news of his sister al-Turfa, who is very ill. ""She came down with a terrible illness (wajaʿ) at the beginning of Marḥeshvan, which lasted two months, and the illness culminated in a stomach abscess (? dhubayla ʿalā raʾs fuʾādhā). There was not a doctor in Fustat that we did not bring to see her or a single medicine or syrup that we did not give her to drink. After this, terrible fainting fits (ghashw, probably = ghashwa) came over her. We asked her, having despaired of her, saying, ""What do you want? What do you desire?"" And she said, crying, ""By God, there is no desire (shahwa) in my heart and no........ [the fragment ends here].""

Also ambiguous is whether 'raʾs al-fuʾād' refers to the stomach or rather to the skin overlying the heart (as it does in al-Razi's casebook). See CUL Or.1080 J24 for another account of a woman with a prolonged illness who developed fainting fits (ghashawāt).

Abū l-Faraj al-Qubaybiyya(!) to his mother in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic.

He conveys greetings also to his own wife whom he calls ṣāḥibat al-bayt. Goitein reasonably assumed that the word Qubaybiyya referred to the mother, and he noted that two villages in the Aṭfīḥ district are called Qubaybāt. However, the word appears with Abū l-Manṣūr's name rather than his mother's, and the word is unambiguously part of his own name in ENA 2806.4, his petition to Maṣliaḥ Gaʾon. It may be a toponym referring to one of the villages called Qubayba near Jerusalem, especially if this is the same man called al-Muqaddasī/al-Maqdisī in T-S 6J4.12.

In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Probably no earlier than 14th century, and conceivably much later, based on script and vocabulary. Mentions an area called ḥawsh al-maghāriba in Fustat, where Avraham's sister lives. The letter contains cryptic exhortations about associating with Gentiles, directed at Avraham as well as a certain Raḥel (his wife?). The letter also informs him that his sister's daughter Ḥabība is ""stricken"" (maḍrūba) and is on the verge of death. ""Every day brides and grooms go forth from the neighborhood. I do not wish to confound you by telling you who they are nor how many there are. My son, by God, by God, do not enter the neighborhood until God lifts this affliction from Israel."" Is she referring obliquely to an epidemic, and to the victims as ""brides and grooms""? Verso: Avraham's response to his mother. He expresses his distress at the death of his sister's husband Yaʿaqov and at the news of Ḥabība's condition. He also mentions the harrowing night he spent on a Nile boat after leaving Ḥayyim's house, which he thought he would not survive. Even in the morning, he [vomited?] from time to time and could not hold any food down until God had mercy. The particular words used to describe his symptoms are obscure, possibly as they are late colloquial Judaeo-Arabic. (Information in part from Mediterranean Society, III, pp. 242, 479; IV, pp. 228, 431, and from Goitein's index cards.)

(Information in part from Mediterranean Society, II, pp. 37, 529, and Goitein's index cards.) Many of the specifics of the writer's financial situation are lost. There is an ambiguity as to whether ""ujra"" here means rent or wage/tuition. In ""Side Lights on Jewish Education"" (p. 96), Goitein prefers the latter: ""The community paid for [the tuition of] the sons of those who were impeded by any reason to go after their usual professions (munqaṭiʿ),"" referring to recto, lines 9–11. In this reading, the word munqaṭīʿ refers not to the writer of the letter but to the parents of his pupils who have been unable to pay him. ""[This] teacher receives 1 dirham per pupil and week, probably for special reasons,"" referring to recto, lines 13–14 and 17–19.

The match was identified by Oded Zinger. The other letter is CUL Or.1080 3.46, addressed to her brother Abu ʿUmar Ibn Sabra. The present letter is addressed to Abū l-Faḍl Ibn Sabra, whom Goitein identified as her maternal uncle and as Mevorakh b. Avraham b. Yiṣḥaq Ibn Sabra. She describes some of the background of her current situation: her mother-in-law (the addressee's sister) had long nursed enmity against her. At one point Umm Sitt al-Nās had to leave her own family's location and move in with the husband and mother-in-law. ""First, we all moved into one house. Soon my mother-in-law began to work against me, isolating me from everyone and putting enmity against me into the heart of her son. The least she did was that she said to me: 'Go away and become like your notorious mother.'"" Umm Sitt al-Nās then probably alludes to her mother (the sister of both the addressee and the mother-in-law) when she writes, ""You remember well how everyone reacted to your sister Baqā'."" A man—perhaps the writer's husband or perhaps her father-in-law (per Goitein)—then accused Umm Sitt al-Nās of adultery with her cousin (ibn ʿamm). Ultimately she was turned out of the house, ""naked and lost."" She has been staying with a widow who took her in, and she wishes to travel to her uncle and stay with him, as she has no one else to turn to. She requests 20 dirhams and a mantle (ridā') and a ""women's cap"" (? maʿraqa). Goitein speculated that she is suffering from ""a grave palsy"" (shallan adīda) but there is nothing in the context to suggest an illness, and adīdah is a much rarer word than the other possibility, urīduhu. Perhaps the sentence simply means that in the widow's house, she cannot even obtain a skein of yarn (this would also fit with her preoccupation with her lack of clothing).

Either Ṭoviya or somebody else in his household was ill with a fever, and is now feeling better. Recto is devoted to an intricate tale of levirate marriage (which merits further examination). Ṭoviya seeks Natan's advice and asks him to consult a legal authority regarding the matter. He asks for a bible (muṣḥaf), a loan of a parchment scroll (גביל = גויל), and several piyyutim. He concludes (starting in v13, middle of the line) with an account of the mysterious illness of his wife, whose name may be Bahā' (although בהא is an extremely common word, ""in it"" or ""in her"" does not seem to fit here). Natan must be somewhat familiar already with the illness.

Ṭoviya asks Natan to obtain a prescription from a good physician. See Bodl.

Levi, illness: marad, illness letter 969-1517, Abu Sahl Levi, illness: du'f, illness: chronic, Yedutun ha-Levi, funeral, Illness, illness: su' hal","Fragment of a letter composed circa 1236 CE by Abu l-Ḥasan Yedutun b. Abu Sahl Levi, at one time the cantor of the Palestinian synagogue in Fustat, who signs his name Ḥasan b. Sahl. The letter is a detailed explanation of the funeral and financial arrangements following the death of his father Levi and his brother Moshe, with the aim of exonerating himself from the accusations of Abu l-Bayan and Abu l-Fadl (the sons of Moshe?) that Yedutun “took the property of their father and grandfather.” Yedutun’s father, Levi he-Ḥaver, died on the 24th of Tishrei in 1211. His brother, Moshe b. Levi ha-Levi, died on the 20th of Adar in 1212. (This is consistent with the information from T-S NS 264.98, a letter written by Moshe, indicating that both Moshe and Levi were alive in 1206.) We also learn that Abu l-Mufaddal the judge died in 1212, only a month or so following the death of Moshe. Yedutun repeatedly refers to his own illnesses, claiming that he was too ill to have had any part in the disposition of the estates, let alone steal more than his share. He notes in the postscript, again emphasizing his physical infirmities, ""It has been 24 years since my brother Musa died. [If there is substance to their claims,] how have they ignored this matter for all this time? ... Every penny that falls into my or my wife/family's hands goes to [Abu l-]Bayan... and it is the same with Abu l-Fadl."" This letter clarifies an ambiguity discussed by Shulamit Elizur in her article, “Individual Mourning and National Solace in Early Liturgical Poetry,” Ginzei Qedem 7 (2011), pp. 16–24, in which she presents T-S NS 135.3b (Yedutun’s elegy for his father Levi) and T-S NS 325.135 (Yedutun’s elegy for his brother Moshe). Each poem mourns multiple deaths—a father, a brother, and a judge—in addition to the main subject of the elegy, and this letter clarifies that Yedutun indeed lost a father, a brother, and a judge in rapid succession.

Partnership record. Dating: 1085 (per Goitein's index cards). Written in the hand of Hillel b. Eli (probable, per Goitein). This document is the end of a deathbed declaration in which the dying man accounts for the assets due a partnership in a lead foundry. Apparently the dying man kept an account book; while some assets were held jointly between the dying man, his brother Abū ‘Alī, and one Abū al-Khayr, other assets (including a claim against someone named Yāqūt for 11.5 dinars) were held only between the dying man and Abū al-Khayr. Although Abū al-Khayr may not have been the sole active partner, the document declares trustworthy concerning profit and loss, a phrase often applied to the active partner in a long-distance partnership. Perhaps he had to relinquish some control of the enterprise in his final days as he was ill. His death is recorded on lines 9-10. Although the death of a partner is a sufficient condition for termination of a partnership in Jewish and Islamic law, the typical termination clauses are absent. Rather, the dying man’s brother is to take his place and the partnership is to continue, suggesting an inheritable or transferable, quasi-corporate aspect to the partnership.

Dated to the mid-11th century. (Information from Gil and Ben-Sasson.) The writer and addressee are both unknown. He mentions Abū Yūsuf b. Ismāʿīl [al-Andalusi], known from several other letters of the mid-11th-century. He writes, ""I witnessed things I never wanted to see: the bloodshed was such that I walked on corpses like walking on the ground; a great epidemic (wabā')""; and a great inflation. His own warehouse and that of his brother Saʿīd were pillaged. Years after these events, two months before the death of his father, his father purchased a house with gardens for 100 dinars from a Christian. The civil wars (fitan) then resumed, the house became worthless, and his father died. He and his Saʿīd then set about collecting all the debts owed to their late father and the goods their father had deposited with others, chiefly with one flax dealer. Saʿid told him they would split everything 50/50. The entirety of verso deals with how the writer was initially cheated out of his share of the inheritance—it seems by Saʿīd who was in cahoots with their brother-in-law Yaḥyā b. al-Munajjim—and the aftermath.

He complains that the widow (""the wicked Zeresh"") is threatening, as soon as her son arrives, to accuse him before the local chief of police (wālī) of being the cause of her husband's illness and death. She says, ""The muqaddam excommunicated him and killed him before the entire congregation."" Defending himself, Yiṣḥaq writes, ""You know the ḥamas of the Rīf. A person may die from less than this."" Goitein understands ""ḥamas"" to be the Hebrew word variously meaning violence, anger, injustice, or false witness (but usually referring to governmental persecution in Geniza documents). The writer is thus referring to his own sufferings, countering the claim that he killed the cantor with the claim that the distress caused by such a false accusation puts his own life in danger. The writer admits that popular opinion is against him (anā taḥta safeq fī l-amr). In the bottom, fragmentary portion, he seems to complain that he is not being paid; he also mentions a blanket and ""three sick people, and I am the fourth.""

Hillel, probably in Bahnasa (based on T-S 13J21.18). In the hand of Ḥalfon b. Menashshe. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: 1121–25 CE. She reports that the young son of Sitt al-Jamāl died immediately after ʿEli departed. They buried him in the 'desert' early on Friday, and when they returned, they found Sitt al-Jamāl's son Abū l-Mufaḍḍal sick as well, and he remains in a difficult condition (r6–11). She reports that later the same day, Abū l-Faḍl b. al-Neʾeman was fired from his post by the vizier al-Maʾmūn (1121–25) and was commanded to leave Cairo and take up residence in Fustat. Abū l-Faḍl cannot show his face now, and the rest cannot be explained in a letter (r11–14). ""These things came to me upon emptiness of heart (farāgh qalb)"" (cf. Quran 28:10)—perhaps she means that she could spare no attention for this matter, because she was so preoccupied on account of her children, who are still sick, as the addressee knows. ""My heart became split, rising and falling, and if it weren't for your rebuke, I wouldn't have written you a single letter of all this"" (r14–16). Abū ʿImrān is in the same state (probably of illness) that the addressee knows about (r16–17). She here describes the weaving of a checkered (mutakhkhat) shuqqa cloth and a complex deal involving a silk weaver (al-qazzāz) and the addressee and money to be sent (r19–25). Goitein understands that she owes the silk weaver 9.5 dirhams of wages for the piece of cloth 19.5 cubits long (""Nineteen and a half cubits were not ordered, but the proprietor had given the weaver a certain quantity of silk thread (most probably with the intention of getting 20 cubits) and was notified in the letter of the yield. Here the payment is not called ujra, as usual, but kirā, used today in Egypt for ""rent"" and ""fare,"" but in other countries, e.g., Yemen, for ""wages.""). The addressee's elder son reminds him to send the Hebrew(-script) letter of condolence he had promised. At the very end of the letter, she complains about what they are suffering from the wife of Khalaf and how she is intending to do something (complain / raise a petition?) to the government.

In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating unknown. The letter is convoluted and repetitive, giving the impression of having been dictated. The purpose of writing is to urge the addressee to stop trying to obtain a government salary (jāmakiyya) and to apply only for a license (dustūr), for he if persists in seeking the salary, they will refuse him even the license. The writer and those with him have been on tenterhooks regarding the addressee's news, in a state of anxiety (hamm) and fasting (ṣiyām). He writes that it would be better to treat patients for free than to have the government salary, even if it were 100 dinars. It seems that the government salary would also require the physician to return to Damīra and practice there, an outcome the writer is desperate to avoid. ""If you return to Damīra, it will be our destruction (dimārnā)."" The writer (humorously) insists that here in Damīra there has been no season (faṣl, of illness), and disease (maraḍ) and ophthalmia (ramad) are nowhere to be found; there is no demand for the addressee's services, for everyone is healthy. (Whether intentionally or not, this passage echoes the first chapter of Ibn Buṭlān's Daʿwat al-Aṭṭibā', in which a shifty physician in Mayyāfāriqīn tries to convince a newcomer and potential competitor that all the diseases have disappeared.) The family is not from Damīra originally (the writer calls it bilād al-ghurba); the writer wants to return to their hometown where they own property and do not have to pay 10 dirhams a month for rent. Meanwhile, the family is perishing from the cold, and the children are 'naked.' The writer himself is ill: in a postscript, he writes, ""Do not even ask about me: the illness has gotten seriously worse (zāda bī jiddan). Now, pieces of bloody phlegm (qiṭaʿ balgham dam) are coming up, together with the intense pain (al-alam al-shadīd). How often this flares up in me (yathūr bī)!""

Aharon b. al-ʿAmmānī, in Alexandria, to Abū l-Majd Meir b. Yakhin, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated 23 Shevat, 1208 CE. Yehuda copied for Meir dirges (qinnot) and liturgical poetry (piyyutim). The whole letter deals with the exchange of professional news and information between the two cantors. In particular, R. ʿOvadya the cantor from Damascus was meant to deliver certain piyyutim, but he departed suddenly without warning, which is why Yehuda is sending them with the present letter (r6-12). Yehuda rebukes Meir for sending him vague requests without specifying the opening lines of the piyyutim, which cools Yehuda's ardor for fulfilling his requests (r12-17). He also asks Meir to send back the note about the reading of Deut. 1:44, which Yehuda had seen in the Tāj (the Aleppo Codex) (r17-19). He also wants Meir to send him the fatwa that relates to Yehuda's court case against a judge (r20-22). He asks if ʿOvadya is planning to travel again (r23-24) and concludes with greetings. See Goitein, Med. Soc. II, 548 n. 59, for an explanation of the date in this letter and in T-S 16.287. Yehuda writes 168, with 4800 implied, so the year is 4968.

Aharon Ibn al-ʿAmmānī, in Alexandria, to Abū l-Majd Meir b. Yakhin (""the Glory of the Cantors and their strength""), in Fustat. Dated: 22 Shevat 1525 Seleucid, which is early 1214 CE. In the letter are found the repercussions of the arrival of French rabbis to Alexandria. The community seems to be in a serious crisis due to the lack of leadership. (Information from Frenkel.) Yehuda additionally congratulates Abū l-Majd on his recovery (r.7-12) and agrees that his illness is primarily caused by drinking too much wine and that he should moderate his drinking (r.22-24). He refers to a frail woman (r.14-15). He reports that Abū l-Majd's brother Abu l-Najm Hilal is ill: he never fully recovered since a nail entered his leg months ago, and he does not or cannot open his mouth (r.15-19). He only reports this because it is said that Hilāl may be on his deathbed. (Cf. INA D-55 f.4, also known as IOM D 55.4, summarized in Med Soc II, 220 and V, 155, in which Yehuda writes to Eliyyahu the Judge that “[Hilāl] went to rest in the evening and did not awake in the morning. It was the first day of the holiday, and he was buried on the same day; he left a fine boy of sixteen, who studies with me.” However, Hilāl's fatal illness was different than the one mentioned in this letter, as Hilāl was still alive in December 1214 when he wrote T-S 13J21.27, having recently traveled from Alexandria to Fustat and back.) Yehuda devotes much space to discussing piyyutim that these two cantors have sent or will send each other (r.25-v.9); rebukes Abū l-Majd for failing to date his letters (v.1-4); mentions the financial difficulties in his household (v.9-10); mentions Abū l-Faraj b. al-Rayyis (=Eliyyahu the Judge) and his fundraising for Jerusalem (v.10-13); and ends with a recommendation for R. Shemuel who approached him as he was writing this letter and seems to intend to travel to Fustat. R. Shemuel does not speak Arabic and is dependent on the community's aid (v.13-21).

He asks his brother Abū l-Ḥasan (Yedutun) to send him some sort of letter (כתאב אלמזאיד?) that the owner had requested. He asks the addressee to have the scissors belonging to Furayj repaired without delay and send them to him; he will pay however much it costs. He informs the addressee that his paternal uncle Ṭāhir had spent Shabbat with him. He sends regards to his other paternal uncles, ʿImrān and Bayān. He also sends regards to Bū l-Yusr. 

Verso: letter from Abū Sahl Levi to his son Moshe, with a detailed list of transactions he had conducted on behalf of the recipient. Notably he obtained for his son three dirhams of mastic (ʿilk), a pound of mercury (zaybaq), a pound of barberries, and a half-pound of alum (shabb). He needs the container (kūz) in which he had sent the mercury back without delay, because he gave collateral for it. The addressee still owes a dirham to Ṭāhir and 1 3/4 dirhams to Baqāʾ al-Kohen.

It also mentions a lawsuit filed against Yeshuʿa by one of his Sicilian partners. Yūsuf opens with several lines of sympathy for Yeshuʿa's health problems. First, he was happy to learn of Yeshuʿa's recovery. Then, two letters came with news that he had gotten worse (mā intahā ilayhi ḥālak). Then, Yeshuʿa's own letters came with news of his recovery.

The letter deals with a case to be brought before the Nagid Yehoshua Maimonides (1310–55) b. Avraham II (1245–1313) b. David (1222–1300) b. Avraham (1186–1237) b. Moshe (1135–1204), containing circumstantial evidence (amāra) and details sustaining it. The first part of the letter (r1–17) includes lengthy apologies for failing to visit when he heard that his mother was sick. He was unable to come because of the expense of renting an animal, the danger of the journey, and because he was suffering from ophthalmia ('but now, thank God, I am better'). In the next part of the letter (r18–v1), he informs his mother that he remarried four months earlier, to a beautiful virgin who shares all of his mother's good traits and who is the fulfillment of his mother's prayers for him. His wife is distressed on behalf of her mother-in-law's illness and wishes to come to visit. Goitein suggests that the key to why Surūr neglected to tell his mother or ask her permission prior to the marriage lies in his neglect to mention his wife's name or that she comes from a good family. Most likely, she did not come from a good family, and his mother would have disapproved. In the third part of the letter (v1–27), he gets to the main purpose of writing: he had loaned a siddur to a pilgrim to Palestine named Fakhr against a security of 6.5 nuqra dirhams (containing three times as much silver as regular dirhams). Now that Fakhr has returned to Cairo, he has heard that family members already returned the silver, but Fakhr refused to return the siddur. The writer wishes Fakhr to be pressured to return the siddur. He suggests first that his family tell Sulaymān al-ʿAṭṭār, who mediated the original loan/security, ""So-and-so [Surūr] says such-and-such to you with the following signs."" He then recounts the story of how Sulaymān and Fakhr stayed in the khān in Bilbays with six other pilgrims (al-Shaykh Muwaffaq the cantor, Saʿīd b. al-Kātib, Nāṣir b. Ṭayyib, Yehoshua b. al-Ghāriq, Mūsā b. Mardūk, and Ibn Abū Saʿd al-Khādim), and how they were stranded there over Shabbat when the caravan left. If Sulaymān's intervention doesn't work, Surūr's brother Faraj Allāh should approach the Nagid Yehoshua. He then gives ""signs"" to remind the Nagid of his case: how, when he visited Bilbays, he spoke with Surūr about the copy of a Bible belonging to Yaʿqūb the brother of the teacher; how the Nagid was involved in Surūr's divorce from his first wife; and how the Nagid went to see the head of police (wālī) of Bilbays, who directed him to the Qadi, who was not available. If this doesn't work, he suggests that his brother go to Yaʿqūb the brother of the teacher and solicit his help.

They state that Yehuda also rebuked Abū l-Khayr for the ban of excommunication that he declared, but did not lay hands on him. Nevertheless, on Saturday night, the raqqāṣīn came from Cairo and arrested Yehuda and others, jailing them in the 'shurṭa' in Fustat. On Sunday, the men were brought up to Cairo and were beaten and tortured for several days. 52 dinars were extorted from Yehuda, including a sealed purse of 50 dinars and 2 dinars for the police (the rajjāla and the shurṭa). Yehuda b. Ḥayyim requested that this testimony be drawn up for him, presumably after his release.

Having already repaid 40 dinars, he still owes seven and two-thirds dinars. For this balance, Abū l-Ḥasan wrote a debt document. Abū l-Ḥasan was then free of any obligation to Ḥiyya, and Shelomo handed over the document that obligated Abū l-Ḥasan in the portion of the commenda assets, though he was clear that Abū l-Ḥasan was still subject to the ""oath of partners"", indicating that Abū l-Ḥasan would be liable for mishandling of the commenda assets.

Aharon?) Ibn al-ʿAmmānī, in Alexandria, to his third cousin and brother-in-law the physician Yeshuʿa b. Aharon Ibn al-ʿAmmānī, in the hospital in Cairo. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated: 12 Elul [4800+]168 = 4968 AM, which is 1208 CE (although Goitein's index card says 1217 or 1228 CE, maybe because he was working from a photostat). First section (r5–34): Yehuda specifies the steps he has taken to ensure the addressee's success in the study of medicine in Fustat/Cairo in order to begin practicing in Alexandria. (The pronouns are somewhat confusing in this letter, and it is not out of the question that 'my brother' refers to someone other than the addressee.) Yehuda previously sent instructions with the boy Muhadhdhab b. Merayot al-Kohen. Yehuda advises the aspiring physician to present letters of recommendation to the wālī, to the qāḍī, to al-Muwaffaq, to Ibn Tammām the supervisor (al-mushārif), and to Ibn Ṣadaqa (Goitein says this is a well-known Samaritan physician). Whoever wishes to study with them must study in Fustat and gain his 'certificate of good conduct' (tazkiya) in Fustat. He should strive for nothing but the tazkiya and spare no expenses, because if he obtains the tazkiya, then he will have obtained everything, and he will quickly recover the money that he lost. Yehuda has also enclosed three additional letters with the bearer of the present letter, one of which is a letter from Ibn Alqāsh to al-Shaykh al-Sadīd the aspiring physician's professor (ustādh). Yehuda has also sent 5 letters with the gentile Manṣūr al-Ḥarīrī who is, a relative of the wife of Ibn al-Tinnīsī. 3 of these are from the faqīh Ibn ʿĪsā: the first is a response to the letter from the aspiring physician, the second is a letter of recommendation to a man called al-Sharaf in the hospital, and the third is a letter to the son of the faqīh Salāma Ibn al-Aʿmā (this one is unrelated to the aspiring physician). The other 2 of the 5 letters are from Yehuda himself, one addressed to the aspiring physician and one to the professor al-Sadīd. Yehuda wants to write a letter to al-Shaykh al-Muwaffaq Ibn al-Dimyāṭī but doesn't know his Hebrew name (Goitein understood ""fluency""), so he asks the aspiring physician to send a letter with that information. There are further instructions about Ibn al-Tinnīsī and obtaining a ruqʿa in the hand of the judge (al-dayyān) from the Qaraite al-Shaykh al-Thiqa. Second section (r35–48): Yehuda has sent several additional letters with ʿUmar the animal driver (al-mukārī) because he was worried about his brother. Yehuda is in distress from the capitation tax. Ibn Ruzayq told him that the addressee had guaranteed it for Yehuda. Yehuda argued with Ibn Ruzayq about this, and Yehuda secretly went to the Christian tax administrator (ʿāmil) and obtained an 10-day extension. It seems that the question is whether they ought to pay Yehuda's brother's capitation tax in Alexandria; Yehuda thinks the money would be wasted, since he can't believe that it hasn't already been paid in Fustat, a month in a half after the deadline. The Christian told him that he heard from someone that Yehuda's brother had already paid it to the treasury (bayt al-māl) and that the receipt (wuṣūl) should arrive soon. Yehuda is desperate to know soon, because they are already 'under threat' (taḥt al-tahdīd). Third section (r49–end): Yehuda describes a shameful matter in Alexandria, namely, how the government banished the scholar and merchant Yosef al-Baghdādī as a result of false accusations made by associates of the judge Anatoli. Yehuda had previously sent an update on this matter with ʿUmar al-Baghdādī. There was an initial denunciation to the Jewish judge somehow involving a convert and a claim that Yosef threw watermelon rinds and urine at someone (v3–4). Then there was a scene in the synagogue involving the tearing of clothes and Yosef either genuinely fainting or pretending to faint. Anatoli, Seʿadya al-Ḥasid, Hilāl (probably the brother of Meʾir b. Yakhin), and the allies of Anatoli were also there. Yosef was then denounced to the amir Ḥusām al-Dīn as someone who curses the Jewish law and who must be banished from the city. So the amir sent 'the black slave' and his attendant (farrāsh) to search for Yosef, calling out, 'Where is the foreigner who is cursing people and their ancestors?' Yehuda attempted to conceal Yosef from the search party by saying, 'This is a humble scholar and teacher who would never do such a thing.' But their informer Ṭāhir al-Dimashqī told on Yosef, and Yehuda received a reprimand for obstructing the government's justice. There follows a detailed description of the expulsion of Yosef.

In the hand of Avraham b. Natan Av. No witness signatures. Location: Cairo. Dated: Thursday, 27 Adar I 1415 Seleucid, which is 1104 CE. The document contains the proceedings before the court regarding the matter of dispute between two members of the community of Malīj, Shelomo b. Avraham (aka Salāma b. Ibrāhīm al-Sayrajī) and Peraḥya ha-Kohen b. Ṭarfon (aka Abū l-Surūr b. Ṭarīf). The story opens with a verbatim copy of another testimony (called a sheṭar/maḥḍar) dated 2.5 months earlier (Saturday night 12 Ṭevet 1415 Seleucid), in which the witnesses Mevorakh b. Yiṣḥaq, Yosef b. Mevorakh, and Elʿazar b. Yosef testify that they entered the house of a Jew named Bashshār and found Salāma b. Ibrāhīm assailing Abū l-Surūr b. Ṭarīf and hanging on to his clothing; the latter was not defending himself. Salāma insisted on taking Abū l-Surūr before the government (sulṭan); Abū l-Surūr insisted on taking Salāma to the Jewish courts (before 'the Rayyis'). Salāma then insulted the Rayyis and said, ""I am [King] Baldwin (Bardawīl), and Abū l-Surūr is my prisoner!"" Salāma summoned the police (rajjāla) and had Abū l-Surūr and Yūsuf b. Rajā and Yūsuf b. Manṣūr taken before the Muslim courts/government (headed by ""the amir""). The amir nearly had the defendants beaten. (End of first document.) Now, Abū l-Surūr has finally succeeded in bringing Salāma before the Jewish court and ""sayyidnā"" (though the pronouns are not entirely clear in l. 4 and it could also be Salāma suing Abū l-Surūr). The court orders Salāma to justify his behavior. Salāma says to summon the witnesses. The court refuses, saying, And what if they don't obey the order? Abū l-Surūr says that the court should use the ḥerem stam (blanket excommunication) to coerce people into reporting any communication they received from Salāma to antagonize Abū l-Surūr before the Muslim courts. Either Salāma or Abū l-Surūr at this point accuses the other of bearing false witness in the Jewish court (""before Sayyidnā""). The court reads out a letter that Salāma confesses to be his own, in which he accuses a troublemaker (=Abū l-Surūr) who had been exiled from Malīj to Cairo of sending letters to Ibn al-Qāsh the dyer and to the shoṭer and the nadiv to the effect that they aren't rid of him yet, since he will return as soon as Rabbenu dies. The court asks Salāma on what basis he made that claim, and Salāma can only respond that someone (he refuses to say who) told him about Abū l-Surūr's alleged letters. The court believes Abū l-Surūr's side of the story, but also issues a ḥerem stam commanding anyone who did receive a troublemaking letter from Abū l-Surūr to come forward with it. The shoṭer and the nadiv are present, and they deny receiving any such letter from Abū l-Surūr. The document ends abruptly with the line, ""The day broke, and the crowd dispersed."" ASE","S. D.

The son loved music, Italian wine and bad company, and, of course, was always in debt. All attempts of the father to correct him: presenting him to the qadi of Alexandria, taking him on a trip to Ifrīqiya, sending him to the countryside on administrative work, suggesting to him travels to Yemen and to Syria were of no avail. The young man of twenty-two was not a mere good-for-nothing. He was allergic to his father: 'as long as you are alive, I have bad luck. As soon as you are dead, I shall be successful.'

The sender of the response says only that he too missed the sender of the original letter and twice urges him to greet Abū Manṣūr the cantor on his behalf.

The sender reports on a circumcision that he performed on the 9th of Av for (the newborn son of) Mufaḍḍal al-ʿAnbarī, the paternal uncle of Muhadhdhab and Abū Saʿd al-ʿAnbarī. He then reports that the majlis of the Head of the Jews (=David I Maimonides) has been closed (the sender is on the side of David's opponents). R. Ḥananel has disappeared; some say that he went to Qūṣ, some say Alexandria, and some say he is hiding in Fustat. His son now gives public lectures on Shabbat and Monday and Thursday eves. ""The ban of excommunication, the shofar, and the name of the Rayyis in the ketubba have all vanished from Fustat/Egypt."" On Shabbat Devarim, the new Nasi, the brother of Shelomo, delivered the sermon. The same day, a decree was proclaimed, requiring Christians and Jews to wear a distinctive mark (ʿalāma and zunnār) under threat of life and forfeit of property. The sick son of Mardūk is improving; ""the wife"" is in her 7th month of pregnancy; the pressing (of grapes) has been much delayed this year.

She then lists all the people who have died (mātū yā ummī māt. . .): the elderly Dāwudiyya (female descendant of David); the wife of al-Kāzarūnī who was the paternal aunt of the wife of Yehuda; the son of Ibrahim the Deaf—no one has been able to bury him for two days, ""they say he is ḥashrī,"" probably meaning ""without heirs"" rather than ""verminous"" (see Lecker, ""Customs Dues at the Time of Muhammad,"" al-Qantara, XXII, 2001, p. 33). (Unless the concentration of deaths means it was plague time, and some corpses were regarded as hazardous?) As for the writer's own news, she swears by the Sabbath day that she has had financial trouble with her landlord, who seems to have given her a loan and to have come on Friday to demand a payment. She had to pawn her daughter's ring. ""Do not ask what trouble I had with Maʿānī yesterday. Tell him (the landlord?), 'He (Maʿānī?) is not hiding. It is just that he has had ophthalmia (ramad) for 20 days. Be patient. He will soon work and repay you in installments just like he took (the loan) in installments.'"" The bottom of the letter may be missing. On verso, she addresses (2) Abū Manṣūr, and exhorts him, ""Be diligent in your work, and everything will turn out well for you (yajīk kull shay' mustawī)."" She makes some cryptic statements, which may mean, ""As for what Umm Yehuda said, pay no mind. I have told you that the Rabbanite should pay the debt of the Samaritan on your behalf. This would be good luck and an end to the setbacks."" (It is from this line that Goitein deduced that the writer was a Karaite.) She says she is working as hard as she can for the sake of ""the dowry"" (? al-mahr) and has already paid ʿUbayd a qadaḥ and a half of flour and some honey and two pieces of firewood and a qadaḥ of vetch (julubbān) and lye (? ghāsūl). She mentions an underfilled (? muṭaffafa) clay vessel (burniyya) and asks the addressees to send it back to her properly filled (lā tuṭaffūhā). Finally, she addresses (3) her brother Abū Thābit. ""I have no counsel for you except that they are your guests. Do not be heartsick on your brother's account. Do not spurn (? tufqir) my advice, and you will overcome much misfortune (?). Do good deeds. He who digs the hole (al-zūbīya) falls in it. Do not lay a hand on him. . . You will regret it very much and say, 'That old woman (al-qaḥba) my sister was right.'"" ASE.","S. D.

Yakhin, in Fustat. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated: 1216/17 CE (1528 Seleucid). The writer urges the addressee to come see his sister, who is very sick. She has a throbbing pain (ḍarabān) in her right hip; a burning pain in her heart; a nonhealing wound (the word looks like khalal) in her right thigh; and her tongue is dry. She prays to God that she will see the addressee's face before she dies. ""When your [brother?] said to her, 'Let her take the rhubarb-barberry pastille and make it […] and hopefully it will abate,' my master, she said, 'I do not want any of this unless he obtains a prescription, and the prescribing physician prepares it for me and sends it.' This is deliverance, my master. They prescribed hiera oil (duhn al-iyārij) for her thigh, but it was not effective. What is killing her is the pain in her thigh. I do not need to urge you to come. If her condition becomes fatal, your mother will die next. She will never live after her. The best is for them to slake their yearning for you, and you will gain your mother’s prayers."" The letter continues with an update on the addressee's brother Hilāl ('his condition is the same'); a description of a large funeral; something to do with the addressee's request for Masā'il Ḥullin and how he needs to be more specific; a long series of rebukes for the addressee's negligence in writing; and regards to various people.

Eliyyahu, Avraham Maimonides, 13th c, death, Petition, prayer reforms","Letter in Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Likely Tammuz 1232 CE, and almost definitely 1232–37 CE. See below for explanation. Writer and addressee are unidentified. The writer dictated the letter to his son. They were evidently affluent merchants and suppliers to the army. The letter is mainly about the controversy over the prayer reforms of the Nagid Avraham Maimonides. The sons of the Sixth (the family members of the previous dynasty of Nagids) submitted a petition against Avraham to the Sultan al-Malik al-ʿĀdil, to which Avraham responded with a counter-petition signed by almost 200 people from the community, testifying that he had not forced his prayer reforms on anybody. The writer maintains that all those who signed in favor of Avraham testified falsely and deserve to be punished by the shaving of their beards, for he claims that Avraham certainly did force his prayer reforms on the community in their synagogues. The writer goes on to report on recent deaths, including that of Shelomo b. Eliyyahu (who predeceased his father) and Yūsuf b. al-Kharrāz (who ate dinner and went to sleep and died; in the morning, his face was ""black as ink""). There is a section on the prices of various commodities, a section on relations with the military officer Kātib al-ʿArab, and greetings. As for the justification for the dating: Avraham Maimonides died in 1237. There were two sultans named al-Malik al-ʿĀdil. The first was the brother of Saladin and reigned 1200–18. The second was the grandson of the first (the son of al-Malik al-Kāmil) and reigned 1238–40, after the death of Avraham Maimonides. However, during the years 1232–38 when al-Malik al-Kāmil lived in Syria, al-Malik al-ʿĀdil the Younger sometimes represented his father in Egypt. Goitein determined that the reference must be to al-Malik al-ʿĀdil the First, which would date the document to 1204–18. But the plot thickens, because Shelomo b. Eliyyhau—whose death is reported in this document—was still alive in the month of Av in 1231 CE (Med Soc II, 575 n. 60) and Heshvan 1231 CE (Freer F 1908.44H). The present letter is dated Sunday 5 Tammuz. This narrows the window to 1232–37 CE. The trouble is that the 5th of Tammuz can never fall on a Sunday.... so either the scribe was off by a day or meant to write 15th of Tammuz. The latter option is supported by the phrase ""may its sadness be turned to joy,"" which might refer to the upcoming 17th of Tammuz fast.

All clothing and provisions of wheat and wine hoarded in the house of the writer's maternal uncle were plundered; even the rope of the well was taken way. The authority ordering the requisition is referred to as the biblical 'Haman the wicked'. (Information from Mediterranean Society, II, p. 393.) The sender himself was interrogated by the raqqāṣīn who were searching for his uncle, but he pretended to be not from there and fled. 

The letter refers to three obscure torture devices or techniques: ""they in{ser}ted the ʿṬY (עטי), the hinbāzīn (הנבאזין), and the khazm (? כזם) in their (the Jews') noses (v3). Later, the sender explains that a person who has had the ʿṬY enter his flesh will not heal (r5–6). The meaning of ʿṬY is not clear; khazm is also not clear, but comes from a root referring to piercing, sometimes nose piercing. The term hinbāzīn/הנבאזין/هنبازين is apparently known from Coptic martyrologies (according to some sources deriving from Greek ἑρμητάριον < Latin armentarium < Armentarius, the nickname of the emperor Galerius Maximianus); see https://st-takla.org/Coptic-Faith-Creed-Dogma/Coptic-Rite-n-Ritual-Taks-Al-Kanisa/Dictionary-of-Coptic-Ritual-Terms/9-Coptic-Terminology_Heh-Waw-Yeh/henbazeen.html and Phillips Barry, ""Martyrs' Milk"" (1914) (https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Open_Court/VuoXAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ermetarion&pg=PA563&printsec=frontcover). 

Recto (original use): Ketubba for Sitt al-Banāt. In the hand of Natan b. Shelomo ha-Kohen (1125–50). The ends of 6 lines are preserved. The groom undertakes not to curse her or treat her with disrespect. The identification of the scribe as Natan b. Shelomo ha-Kohen allows us to tentatively date the letter to the last years of Maṣliaḥ Gaʾon (1138–39) when there was a mutiny against the government, and Maṣliaḥ picked the wrong side, so that many Jews were jailed and Maṣliaḥ himself was executed in 1139.

The list is in the unmistakable hand of the judge Nathan b.

Najm al-Din read it with me in Giza and wrote a response in his own hand. A letter with Abu l-Ḥasan arrived with the news that you are sick, and we were pained on your account, myself and the mother. As for Tawus and Mas'udah, they did not greet us (?). The old woman and Mas'udah fought, she said to her, ""You claim that I owe you something, I don't owe anything to anybody!"" We went to Abu l-Khayr, I and the Hakim, as soon as Abu l-Ḥasan arrived with the letter. We fought with him. We said, ""Give the ghazal (?), we will do it outside."" But he didn't do it. He prepared it and he will do it. As for what you sad, my brother, that I should rise and come, you know that I am busy with the speaking (?) of Najm al-Din until matters are stable (?) with him. On Wednesday, the day after the arrival of the letter, I went to Amin al-Din the son of the founder and bought five of indigo (nīl) from him. I gave him your letter and he read it and I kissed his hand and humbled myself and cried. He was pained and said, come back another time. He is good of heart and wishes for your delivery. He promised me. Every day I await for the response from him, and every day I go to him -- may God grant that salvation is at his hands, and the next letter after this one will tell of your salvation. My brother, I cannot travel until I have a letter with news of your delivery. There is no sense in traveling like this. I can't even buy or sell things until your matter is settled and the speaking (?) of Najm al-din. As for what you said about going to to al-Shams b. al-Muzawwiq - he did not leave me in Giza after he read your letter except that he was good (of health?). Maybe we don't need any of them. You know that he does not have any influence apart from money. Until now, nothing has been settled between me and him. If you need money, send word with someone you trust, and we will give it to him. My brother, there is fire in our hearts because of you. Mother and your sister and the Hakim all want to come to you. A blond apostate (poshea') arrived after Abu l-Ḥasan's letter and said that you had departed. Someone wanted to write a letter to someone; but he searched for you and did not find you. He calmed our hearts a great deal. He told us that your leg hurts you. Their fear was calmed, and they recovered from their state....""

He devotes much of the letter to a vivid description of his illnesses. “As for my state, I inform the masters that I came down with diarrhea, and I endured it. When it increased and multiplied, it became an illness. A physician was treating me, al-Rayyis Sulaymān al-Ḥakīm al-Fāḍil of the family of Rabbenu Menaḥem (ZL). They concocted the medicine in the house of Rabbenu (ZL): every day, roasted seeds and the like, and a pullet, and he visited me frequently. And R. Eliyya the Judge was also generous. When I recovered after some days… [I came down] with what was worse than it… ophthalmia in my eye on the night of Shabbat Shoftim… a painful scream, against my will, all night…. May God afflict my enemies [with what I was afflicted with]. The illness became public. What I suffered cannot be [described].” In the continuation, he sends regards to the judge Peraḥya and praises him as the most learned and powerful judge in the country. He concludes, ""As for my eye, fog and darkness were upon it."" There is a postscript in the same hand but in the third person (perhaps meaning that a secretary wrote this letter for Jalāl al-Dawla or that somebody later copied it): ""After he wrote this letter, he entered the bathhouse (meaning, he was fully recovered) on the 26th of Elul, so be glad of heart.""

Partnership release. Dated: 7 Shevat 1390. Location: Fustat. An olive-oil partnership is dissolved. This fragment contains two documents related to the same partnership agreement, filed in the court one after the other over a two-day period in January 1079. The first document, unsigned and seemingly copied in lines 1-12, represents the termination of a partnership and a corresponding mutual release of three partners, Ghālib b. Ḥalfōn, Moses b. Ghālib, and Meshullam b. Furqān. Ghālib releases Moses and Meshullam; Moses and Meshullam release Ghālib. That Moses and Meshullam did not release one another in this document suggests either that the document was Ghālib’s copy of a mutual release and that other copies were written for Moses and Meshullam, or that Ghālib was the active partner and Moses and Meshullam were his investors. If the latter, Moses and Meshullam would have had no mutual obligations and therefore no need to release one another. This explanation is consistent with lines 13-28, which describe Ghālib and Moses' partnership. As a settlement, Ghālib agrees to pay Moses and Meshullam  each month in order to settle the balance (seven dinars). Meshullam's role in the partnership is unclear; only Ghālib and Moses are mentioned as partners in the olive-oil concern.

Abū ‘Imrān Moses contributed 124.5 dinars out of 484.5 dinars (the latter contributed the balance) and agreed to split profits and losses evenly. Moses traveled to al-Shām and sent merchandise back to the Fustat agency house of Abū al-Ṭāhir b. Rajā, a Muslim. This document was likely written directly after Moses’ death and concerns itself with the division of partnership assets between Moses’ heirs Nathaniel and Aaron and the investor Samuel, mentioning commodities deposited in the names of the heirs, and also those ""allocated to the Elder Abū al-Baqā"".

The Crusaders were attacking al-Manṣūra, and the sender was in the army camp together with a gentile (presumably Muslim). He had three books with him, including a commentary and some of the 'kalām' of Maimonides (=Guide for the Perplexed?) as well as the Īlāqī. The Muslim companion had no eyes for anything but the Īlāqī, and he offered money to borrow it, copy it, and return it. As everyone was penniless at the time, the sender agreed, but he never saw the book again.

Abraham Ibn Sabrī and Abū ‘Imrān Moshe b. Mordecai ha-Kohen for a yearlong partnership in a shop selling olives and food commodities. Mevorakh and Moshe invested 80 and 50 dinars, respectively. Moshe seems to be in charge of the shop, garnering two-thirds of the profit and being responsible for two-thirds of the losses. He must prepare a reckoning at the end of the year, without required notarization. However, if the partnership has decreased in value, there is to be a judgment between the partners. The partners are not allowed to quit the partnership before the end of the one-year period, after which they may either renew or terminate it. However, if they decide to terminate, Moshe has two months to return Mevorakh’s investment. Mevorakh, a Parnas, must have been involved in social welfare tasks. Moshe has much autonomy in the shop, taking on “trust in Heaven” that he will not defraud his partner in absentia.

The writer then safely arrived in Akhmīm on Friday as evening was falling, so he spent Shabbat in the city. He had to pay 10.5 dirhams (of customs?) upon leaving on Sunday, after swearing that he had nothing with him except the clothes (? qumāsh) on his back. He mentions al-Shaykh Abū Isḥāq b.

The caliph, then twenty-nine years old and tired of being cloistered in the shadows of highhanded dictators, attempted after 1125 to rule by himself. Unfortunately, however, he entrusted financial affairs to a rapacious Coptic bureaucrat, Abū Najāḥ ibn Qannāʾ, known as ""the Monk"" (al-rāhib), who, from the autumn of 1126 until his execution in 1129, managed to terrorize all segments of the populace, including the Jews, with his promiscuous confiscations and arrogant demeanor"" (Cohen, Jewish Self-Government, p. 284).

Yosef was asked why he sued his brother in the Muslim courts, and he said that he demanded from Hillel multiple times that he return the female slave and take his 14 dinars back. But Hillel refused, and Yosef became angry and took an oath to sue him in the Muslim courts. What happened next is harder to understand, and the document needs further examination.

From Nahray's title and from the fact that Nissim is already grown up and involved in trade, one can conclude that the letter was written in the late nineties of the 11th century.

There are only four days between the Day of Atonement and the beginning of the Feats of Tabernacles. The letter seems to assume that, say, on the third day of the interval between the two holidays most of the pledges had already come in. Another interesting point is the Nagid's admonition to think of the poor on the Siyyum (Heb.), the festive conclusion of the yearly reading of the Pentateuch, which takes place at the end of the autumn holidays.

Dating: September 1153 (Goitein) or 1152 (Friedman). It appears that Ibn Yijū and Yosef had fallen out of direct touch, but he wants to renew contact and, not unrelated to that, to propose marrying their children to one another. (1) Ibn Yijū says he has heard that Yosef has three sons, and he explains in a very moving passage that he himself had two sons in India (tender? pleasant? ""as the twigs of sweet basil"" but both died in childhood. (2) Ibn Yijū then turns to the matter of his daughter: while Khalaf b. Bundār, the wealthy trader in Aden, wanted his son to marry her, Ibn Yijū preferred her to marry her cousin Surūr, who was not wealthy, and who was a refugee from Ifrīqiya to Mazara. Says Ibn Yijū: ""My brother’s son is more deserving (of her) than strangers.” Goitein often quoted this line to argue for a preference for endogamy and cousin-marriage, but Krakowski persuasively argues (Coming of Age, 218–21) that this situation is too specific to be generalizable: Ibn Yijū seems to want, instead, to use cousin marriage ""not to affirm and reify existing social loyalties, but to create an essentially new connection between socially distant relatives"" (221). But Ibn Yijū's explicit motive is different: he says he wants his future son-in-law to be ""learned in Torah"" (r12), and he's heard from both their other brother, Mevasser, and the Sicilian merchants in Aden and Fustat said that Surūr fits the bill. (3) The complicated relationship between the two brothers — in some ways a classic older/younger sibling dynamic — emerges clearly when Ibn Yijū alternately turns on the charm, perhaps to sweeten the marriage proposal, and scolds his brother. He explains that he's sent him a mixture of pepper and ginger, but then he admonishes him for losing a previous gift of pepper ""through incompetence"" (bi-ʿajzika, r31); he asks his brother not only to write back to him, but cheekily adds that he should send Surūr to Fustat with the letters; and then he explains that if it weren't for the departure of the ships westward with the Salībiyya winds (late September, so-called after the Coptic Feast of the Cross on 26–27 September), he would have sent further gifts for him and his sons. (4) He then complains about their other, good-for-nothing brother, Mevasser, describing him as ""indolent"" and ""hard of heart"" and blaming him for his own financial losses. (5) Then follows the usual litany of greetings to your two (crossed out) three sons, their mother, their sister Berākha, her children, her husband, Marwān, their children again; to the otherwise unattested Barhūn b. Ḥassūn b. ʿAṭiyya, who is connected with Ibn Yijū's (other?) sister; to R. Moses ""the great cantor."" On the dating of the letter: Goitein dates the document to September 1153 because this letter was written from Egypt, and Goitein believes Ibn Yijū to have traveled from Aden to Cairo in spring or summer 1153, while the reference to the Salībiyya winds indicates that this letter was written in September — hence September 1153; Friedman, however, believes that Ibn Yijū arrived in Egypt in 1152, and indeed, at r22, Ibn Yijū explains that his daughter had been engaged to the son of Khalaf b. Bundār in Aden for three years, while we know from IB III,29 that they had arrived in Aden in fall 1149. MR","S. D.

The fragment was written by the same scribe who wrote AIU D 75 which is a fragment from Siddur R. Shelomo ben Natan that was written in the twelfth century.

The respondent expresses his displeasure that the betrothal was conducted by someone who was not 'experienced in the matter of marriage and divorce' and requests to know how exactly the marriage was conducted: were the objects of betrothal handed directly to the bride or her representatives, and were those appointed in front of two witnesses? Was the expression 'for the purpose of complete betrothal' uttered when then objects of betrothal were handed over?

The father might have been going through the divorce procedures while the son was handling the arrangements of the wedding with the new wife.

Menashshe ha-Levi. Dated: last decade of Tishrei 1438 Seleucid = October 1126 CE. This was before the period of Maṣliaḥ Gaʾon (1127–39) and hence there is no reshut clause. Groom: Abū Sahl Menashshe b. ʿAmram Ibn al-Jubayliyya. Bride: Banāt bt. Nuʿmān ha-Kohen, also known as Sitt al-ʿItra. Lines 11-12 set a date for the marriage (before Nisan of the current year), meaning the deed was written prior to the wedding day. The agreement is presented in the first person reducing the probability that it is a betrothal agreement. The fact that the document refers to the bride as 'mumallaka' (betrothed or his fiancee; fiancee is more probable) shows that the agreement was made after the engagement took place. It is possible that during the engagement no agreement was written or that the agreement was not comprehensive and therefore this agreement was written. Despite the fact that the manuscript is incomplete it is probable that the bride represented herself, despite the fact that her father was alive: the groom testifies that he handed over to the bride the money directly. Moreover, there is no mention of a representative of the bride. The document has not been published or mentioned elsewhere.

Two manuscripts that deal with the marriage of a bride named Karam. The two manuscripts contain the bride's consent to the marriage, her receiving the initial marriage gift (Muqaddam) and an appoint of a representative on her behalf. The first manuscript, ENA NS I.95a, from the 3rd of Nissan (Monday, the 14th of March) year 1244, is a testimony of witnesses that the bride gave in their presence her consent to the marriage to the aforementioned Groom, and that she received the initial marriage gift (Muqaddam) and accepted the sum of the delayed marriage gift (Me'ukhar). The story takes an unexpected twist in the second manuscript dated two days afterward. While the wife testified in the previous document that she received the initial marriage gift and accepted the sum of the delayed marriage gift, in the second document she appoints her brother to receive the initial marriage gift and to set the sum of the delayed marriage gift. Since the ending of the first document did not survive it is impossible to determine what took place in those two days. The wife might have wanted to testify that she received the muqaddam but things did not turn out the way they should have (the two sides might have fallen into dispute and the agreement was not signed?) Thus, direct involvement of the bride's wife was required. Another option is that the brother's appointment as representative was carried out informally before receiving the initial marriage gift, but only later was this formalized in court.

Engagement agreement between a Qaraite man (Abū Saʿīd) and a Rabbanite woman (Sitt al-Naṣr bt. Netan'el ha-Kohen). Goitein suggests that it is an agreement between a husband and wife that was composed after a quarrel (Med. Soc. 3:152–53). But Ashur judges the document to be an engagement agreement because the early marriage payment (muqaddam) is mentioned and there is a condition that the muqaddam will be considered 'a gift', alongside many other conditions common in agreements before the marriage. These conditions include: not to bring into the house anything forbidden by the Rabbanites (ṭā'ifat al-rabbānīn), that the early marriage payment is a gift, that he will not marry a second wife nor take a concubine if she disapproves, on pain of having to pay the delayed marriage payment and giving her a divorce, etc. NB: Goitein and Ashur referred to this document as folio 17 (Firk.

Fragment refers to someone designated as 'the elevated presence.' Verso of the letter mentions the murder of Fakhr al-ʾUmara near Alexandria and also mentioning ʾAmīr al-Jūyūsh, which was the title of Badr al-Jamālī, the Armenian general and actual ruler of Egypt, 1074-1094 (see Cohen, Jewish Self-Government, pg. 61-65). Fakhr al-ʾUmara was a title of the viziers of the sword (arbāb al-sūyūf) and was third in the ranks of such viziers (see al-Qalqashandī, Ṣubḥ al-Āʿashā, pg. 104). The vizier in question could be the brother of Nāṣir al-Dawla who was the Turkish military commander during the time of the Fatimid Caliph al-Mustanṣir Billah. He (Fakhr al-ʾUmara) is also referred to as Sulṭān al-ʿArab in some historical sources (see ʿImāduddīn, ʿŪyūn al-Akhbār, vol. 7, pg. 61-65). He was assassinated by Badr al-Jamālī, among other rebels, including Nāṣir al-Dawla, upon entering Egypt for their insurgents and rebels against the state which caused political unrest in the country for almost a decade (1062-1072). While Badr al-Jamālī was restoring law and order in Egypt and assassinating the rebels, many factions of the rebel army and clans surrendered to him to avoid persecution. This letter mentions Badr al-Jamālī receiving such letters from the Lawāta Berbers and other clans, as well as a delegation from Sulaymān (the name demands further inquiry). The letter also mentions (Ibn?) Hamūd, also Ibn Hamdān or Ibn Hamdūn, (the name appears with variations in historical sources) I.e., the name of Nāṣir al-Dawla as giving an account of these events. Badr al-Jamālī entered Egypt in 467/1075, hence this letter could be dated to that year.

In Judaeo-Arabic. Frenkel identifies the writer's location as Alexandria, the addressee as Ismāʿīl al-Fāṣid, and the date as 1176 CE, but does not seem to explain her reasoning. The letter recounts an interesting family saga. The addressee's maternal uncle passed away while traveling with the addressee to India. The addressee took care of him before his death. The family has taken great pains to conceal the news of the uncle's death until they receive a detailed account of his will. This long letter repeatedly describes everyone's anxiety waiting for news of the addressee's health and the will. His mother, when she heard of the death of her brother and the news of the addressee's difficulties at sea, fell sick and fasted until news came of the addressee's health. His father stays up all night praying for him. ""If you knew how much reward (in Heaven) you receive from every letter you write us, you would do nothing but write us letters."" The family congratulates the addressee on his purchase of a male slave (ghulām). Finally, the reason for the anxiety about the will comes to light at the end. The uncle knew or thought that his wife was pregnant when he departed, however, they counted 9 months, and there was no baby. They counted another 9 months, and she had a baby boy. The family evidently wishes to ensure that none of the uncle's inheritance ends up with his wife or son. Even the Muslims say, ""We have never heard anything like what this Jewish woman has done. She deserves nothing but hellfire."" The widow was able to round up some allies from among the Byzantine Jews, and they managed to gather 10 Jews for the circumcision, but with no cantor or judge present. In the midst of sending everyone's regards in the margin of verso, the writer reports sarcastically that the newborn infant also sends his.

The writer had deposited the money (and other goods) with this Abū l-Faraj on the night before he traveled; this was witnessed by another cousin (ibn khāla) of Eliyyahu, Manṣūr b. Sahlān. The writer told Abū l-Faraj to draw up a contract for the deposit/loan, but he never did so. (Probably he is now denying that he owes anything.) ""If I had known that the matter would turn out like this, {I} wouldn't have given him a penny. . . . My greatest need from you is to rebuke Abū l-Faraj, for he is a heretic [zindīq]. My only salvation from him will be through God and through you. I am shocked at how he treated my son. . . . I am now a piece of flesh: I lack money, sight, and a living."" He mentions his weak vision earlier in the letter, too, when explaining the ""delay of my raḥl (merchandise? travel?)."" Also of interest in the letter is what Abū l-Faraj conveys about his hospitality for Eliyyahu's son, the physician Abū Zikrī, who returned from Jerusalem the previous year. Initially, Abū Zikrī stayed with Abū l-Faraj the son of the Parnas. But after Yom Kippur, the writer said, ""He should stay with me instead of with strangers."" And thus they lived together, ""head to head""—apparently an expression of his great hospitality. When the writer and his son, along with Asad and Abū l-Munā, started preparing to travel (to Fustat?), they urged Abū Zikrī to come with them, citing the wishes of Eliyyahu, but he refused. Asad ended up advancing him 17 dirhams for the capitation tax. Abū Zikrī has no intention of coming, but rather is staying in the house of the writer, along with Sulaymān the Yemeni (perhaps the father of Avraham b. Shelomo the Yemeni, who lived with Abū Zikrī in Jerusalem, and who had family in Bilbays, see T-S 8J16.3 and T-S 13J21.5). Abū Zikrī's motivations seem in part financial—he says he will not come until his father sends him 10 dinars. The letter is full of idiosyncratic spellings, many probably reflecting colloquial pronunciation.

Shelomo, requesting his help in countering a decree that forbade saying piyyutim (Heb. sacred poetry) during prayer. Goitein argued that the letter was written from a country town in Egypt while Friedman suggested that the letter originated from the Jerusalemite Synagogue in Fustat and that the decree forbidding piyyutim was part of the Hasidic reforms of prayer which Avraham Maimonides tried to implement. In Frenkel's opinion, the letter was sent from Alexandria. There are a few indications for this in the letter: The mentioning of 'the evils of gentiles' (recto - line 17) fits well with Alexandria which was known for its fanatic atmosphere and for its not uncommon anti-Jewish acts of violence; see Goitein, Med. Soc. 2:278-281. The same is true for the mention of an epidemic lung disease common to Alexandria (recto, right margin line 1 and the note to this line). Furthermore, Alexandria was known for its characteristic prayer customs, to which the Alexandrian Jewish community adhered with zeal; see for example the responsa sent by Saadya b. Berakhot ha-Melammed from Alexandria to Maimonides (Maimonides, Responsa, vol. 1, #113, p. 196; vol. 1, #118, p. 202; vol. 2, #163, pp. 311-312; vol. 2, #259, p. 485). Friedman's argument that the decree forbidding piyyutim originated from Avraham Maimonides fits well with the argument that the letter was sent from Alexandria. A group of pious followers (Heb. Hassidim) of Avraham Maimonides settled in Alexandria and strove to implement in the wider community the principals of their creed. The reference to these pious followers as 'judges, cantors and managers of pious foundations' (Verso, line 3) agrees with other hints about the followers of Avraham Maimonides as enjoying material benefits and neglecting their spiritual mission. On the active followers of Avraham Maimonides in Alexandria see Goitein, 'Our Rabbi Avraham,' Trabitz 33 (1964): 181-197. (Information from Frenkel.) [The suggestion that <em>barāsīm</em> refers to an epidemic lung disease is doubtful. Though the Pahlavi <em>birsām</em> originally meant ""pleurisy,"" in the Arabic medical literature, the word was used interchangeably with <em>sirsām</em>, i.e., phrenitis or delirium. Al-Razi notes that even if physicians sometimes distinguished the two terms, laypeople regarded them as fully synonymous. See Ullmann, Islamic Medicine, pp. 29-30. Both the disease and the death are metaphorical in this letter: ""O Israel, if you see that we have been ended and killed by the frenzies brought against us (by our persecutors), know that we have been killed for the sake of the rite of our fathers and grandfathers and prophets..."" It would not be a martyrdom to be killed by a disease.

Nissim (possibly Ibn Yiju, great-grandson of Avraham Yiju, the India trader) as investors, investing 400 and 200 dinars respectively. There is a reference to ""Arabic documents"" which record the dimensions and location of the factory, and the fact that the brothers inherited part of the factory and purchased the balance from their father. The investors allow the brothers to pursue other investments outside the partnership with partnership funds. Withdrawals from the partnership capital are recorded as a transfer of a share of the ownership from the brothers to the investors, and any rent on this share goes to the investors. The investors are required to return the partial ownership of the factory when the funds are repaid. The Arabic documents record the sale of the factory (and presumably the transfer of the shares) as a ""fixed"" purchase. The brothers remain active partners in the five-year partnership. Partnership profits are divided equally, despite the unequal investments. The brothers will account for their expenses by subtracting from partnership profits 2 dinars per molded block of sugar. Per Goitein, a document at shelfmark T-S NS J215 describes the eventual sale of the factory discussed in this document. (Information from Lieberman, ""A Partnership Culture"", 23-25)","S. D.

Last will of Abū al-Barakāt b. Abū al-Riḍā Yosef al-Lebdi. This deathbed declaration was made in the presence of his sons and of the partner in his sugar factory. This document is largely damaged, but several interesting points emerge. When his eldest son reminds him that according to Jewish law the firstborn was entitled to a double share (Deuteronomy 21:17), the dying man replies: ""I do not prefer one child over another."" Also, he and his business partner mutually declare that they trust each other completely; Abū l-Barakāt’s account books would speak for him after his death. At the end, a large bag with ʿūd (aromatic wood) was brought in, a purse with gold was put into it; the bag was laid into a Rumī (European) chest, which was locked, and the key was put into the hand of the dying man.

There are several indications that the letter was composed in an early stage of the court case between Yosef Lebdi, the India trader, and Yequtiʾel b. Moshe, 'the representative of merchants' in Fustat. An important piece of information in the letter is that on his way back from India, Yosef Lebdi stopped at Mirbat, on the southern coast of Arabia, and from there continued straight to Dahlak, on the western shore of the Red Sea, thereby by-passing Aden (and Ḥasan b. Bundar) completely. Lebdi made arrangements with Bundar that he would forward the money that Lebdi and Yequtiʾel were owed. The fact that Lebdi did not settle his affairs in Aden contributed much to his current conflict with Yequtiʾel. At the time of writing of this letter, the fact that the large shipment of pepper, bought by Lebdi in India, had sunk on the way was unknown to Lebdi and Yequtiʾel in Fustat.","S. D.

Yiṣḥaq testify to the court of how Avraham betrothed his cousin, Sitt al-Ahl b. Yosef Lebdi. Apparently When Yosef Lebdi was alive, Avraham and his mother lived in the Lebdi residence. When both Lebdi and Avraham's mother died, Avraham sought to marry Lebdi;s daughter so that he would still be tied to the great merchant's house. He came to Sitt al-Ahl's house, with two male friends and a certain prominent member of the community to try to secure the match. Lebdi's widow, Sitt al-Ahl's mother, tried to stall and wait until Sitt al-Ahl's older brother, now the man of the house, came back from his journey. Avraham, however, did not want to leave empty handed and pressured the widow to agree. Sitt al-Ahl was summoned and she agreed to the match. Avraham betrothed Sitt al-Ahl with two rings, one of gold and one of silver, and gave her five dinars. All this was done in the presence of her mother and her younger brother. The betrothal was carried out in November 1118 and the court record is from January 1120. Friedman rightly notes that the record was made after it became clear that Sitt al-Ahl was not intending to marry Avraham and, indeed, the court ruled that she is legally Avraham's wife and required a formal bill of divorce. The story can also be read as how a young relative could pressure and almost bully his female cousin to agree to a marriage by coming into her house with two young male friends, while only her widowed mother and young brother were in the house.","S.

Yaʿaqov, in Fustat, to his in-law Abū Zikrī Kohen, in Alexandria. Dating: Sunday, 15 Jumāda = 16 Adar, which is probably 3 March 1135 CE. The letter is an urgent warning advising Abū Zikrī to take all his merchandise out of a warehouse in Alexandria. ""A business partner of Abu Zikrī's in Fustat was dying, and because of the lawlessness prevailing at that time in Egypt, Abu Zikrī's goods would be confiscated together with those of the dead man (before 1129, it seems). {The dying man, Abū Saʿīd, was related to Abu Zikrī's partner the well-known Alexandrian India trader Abu Naṣr b. Elishaʿ. Evidently, Abu Saʿīd did not have any heirs of the first degree, and the officials of the diwan al-mawārīth (line 5: aṣḥāb mawarif!), the Office of Estates, which took advantage ofsuch situations, were about to confiscate all ofhis belongings held by Abu Naṣr. Not taking any chances, the officials would sequester Abu Naṣr's assets and, moreover, those of Abū Zikrī, since the partners' holdings were stored together. The Head of the Yeshiva, certainly Maṣliaḥ ha-Kohen, who in fact was apparently Abū Zikrī's cousin, personally conveyed the warning to Maḥrūz and instructed him to send immediately an urgent message to his brother-in-law Abū Zikrī. For this purpose, Maḥrūz hired a private courier (najjāb) to Alexandria by camel. In his letter, Maḥrūz tells Abū Zikrī to disregard costs and extricate his wares without delay. The warning is repeated in a postscript written after Musallam (see the previous document) informed the writer that the courier would not set out that night. The Head of the Yeshiva's warning is not related to Abu Zikri's urgent request to him in II, 58, since that letter was written several years after II, 59. No. II, 59 is dated Sunday, 15 Jumada. Since Maḥrūz urges Abu Zikri to return to Fustat to be with his family before the approaching holiday, the date can be fixed with a fair degree of certainty as March 2, 1135, when 15 Jumada I came four weeks before Passover. (I do not know why Goitein assumed the letter had been written before 1129.) As already noted, Maḥrūz was not accustomed to writing, and others penned for him most of his letters, which have been preserved, except for this one and V, 20. Because ofthe urgency ofthis letter, he evidently wrote it himself. His untrained hand, poor style and substandard language, replete with vulgar forms and other orthographic irregularities, prove the wisdom of his normal practice.}"" Also of note: Maṣliaḥ Gaon is sick with ""the stone"" (al-ḥaṣā), i.e., a urinary stone (r17).

Joseph recapitulates what had been done thus far and asks Nahray b. Nisslm to intervene with Ḥasan b. Bundār through the merchants returning to Aden. Lines 1-13. Excuses for the writer's long silence: he always inquired after Nahray's well-being, but refrained from writing so as not to obligate a response. Lines 13-29. A letter of Abu 'l-Faraj Nissim, containing the story of his horrible experiences, had been forwarded by Nahray ten months earlier. It caused the family great distress, which was exacerbated by the illness of both the writer's sister (Nissim's wife) and his own wife, an orphan whom he had recently married after the death of his former wife, and who had borne him a sickly boy. Economic difficulties did the rest. ""Man's road is not his [to choose]."" Line 30-verso, line 13. In that letter Nissim had mentioned that he had shipped to Abū ʿAlī Ḥasan b. Bundār 1 1/4 manns camphor with the request to sell them in Aden and to send the proceeds to Nisslm's family; the camphor had arrived in Aden, but Nissim did not know whether Ḥasan had forwarded anything. That letter had been written exactly two years before. Recently a number of acquaintances, all mentioned by name, had arrived from Aden, some with letters and receipts from Adenese merchants. One receipt seemed to be connected with Nissim's shipment, and Nahray is asked to inquire into this and similar matters. Verso, lines 14-24. Having learned that the merchants who had arrived from Aden were returning there, Amram wrote to them letters and now asks Nahray to meet 'all of them' and to give them his letters. They should explain to Ḥasan b. Bundar that his ""taking temporary possession of the camphor's proceeds as security against possible claims"" was a great sin Verso, lines 24-31. On his way to the East, Nissim had met in Dahlak Sheikh Abu 'I-Ḥasan Salāma al-Maʿarrī, the brother of Sheikh Abū l-Ghanā'im. In the aforementioned letter (lines 13, 29 ff) Nissim had written that he had met that man again and asked him to carry with him the proceeds from the camphor from Aden, if they had not been sent before. Nahray is requested to find out whether this man had arrived in Fustat and whether he had brought any helpful message. Verso, lines 31-38. In the concluding part, Nahray is reminded to enquire about another traveler who was reported to have some news on the matter.

Ismāʿīl al-Makhmūrī, in Tripoli, Libya, to her brother Yeshuʿa b. Ismāʿīl al-Makhmūrī. In the handwriting of ʿAllūsh the shammash. Dating: ca. 1065. While Yeshuʿa is dealing with the import and export of goods, his sister asks for help because she is in a very bad situation. T-S 10J19.20 is another version of the same letter (differences are noted in curly brackets in this partial translation). ""I have been waiting all year for a letter from you to learn your news. The fuyūj came, and I did not see a letter. {This increased the preoccupation of my heart.} I went out to inquire about your news, and they told me you were ill (ḍaʿīf). I went out of my mind. {I fasted and wept and did not change my clothing or enter the bath, neither I nor your sister.} I vowed not to eat during the day, not to change my clothing, and not to enter the bath, neither I nor my daughter, until your letter arrived with your news. The ships arrived, and I went down, with my hand on my heart, to hear your news. The men came down and told us that you were well. I thanked God who made the end good."" Goitein, and later Krakowski, used this letter to illustrate the intense affective bonds between brother and sister, as well as the notion of fasting as an intercession for a loved one who is sick (Goitein, Med Soc V, p. 97). Yet it is also the case that their relationship has lapsed—the brother has not contacted the sister in a year, not even sending greetings in his letter to Tammām (""my heart was wounded by this""). In the meantime, she has fallen into terrible financial difficulties. Her vows of self-negation and insistent repetition of ""I have nobody except God and you"" are also a demonstration of how much the sister has suffered from the brother's behavior, how much she thinks about him despite his neglect, and an attempt to elicit a response from him at last. Regarding the specifics of her financial difficulties, see Krakowski, Coming of Age, p. 150, where the relevant passage is translated: ""My brother, I have become embroiled in a quagmire from which I do not think we can be freed—I and a young orphan girl (i.e., her daughter). What occurred was that my son-in-law (i.e., the girl’s fiancé) wintered in Salerno and returned only with the Egyptian ships; then he said to me, “I will take the girl.” I said to him, “What are you thinking? As I was this year, I have nothing.” Then people advised me that I should borrow and incur debt (i.e., for a lavish dowry) and give her to him, because the Rūm (i.e., Normans) have burnt the world. Now . . . if free persons could be sold for dirhams, I would be the first to be sold, for I cannot describe my predicament to you . . . (I swear) by these lines that when Passover came I had not even a farthing’s worth of chard, nor even a dirham; instead I cut a nettle from the ruins and cooked it. . . . My brother, help me with some portion of this debt engulfing me—do not abandon me and do not forsake me."" Yeshuʿa b. Ismāʿīl al-Makhmūrī, incidentally, was prone to illness: see also T-S 16.163 and T-S Misc.25.124 (as noted by Krakowski), and T-S 12.389 and BL OR 5542.20.

Farah, Alexandria, to his son Farah, Fustat. Dating: November 1056. The writer describes the terrible famine in Egypt, which even leads to cases of eating people. The writer also describes the epidemic in the area. Despite all that, business continues. He writes about pepper, flax, and oil. (Information from Gil, Kingdom, Vol. 3, #495) VMR. The part about the epidemic begins in line 14 of recto. ""There is a great epidemic (wabā') in the cities of the coast. As for Qayrawān, no one remains there [alive? or who has not fled?]—may God preserve you in health. Do not go roaming about the villages, for these are difficult times. [Or, if you read mā instead of lā, ""Difficult times have recurred in the villages.""] By God, by God, be vigilant for yourself. 'Who is called wise? He who sees the consequences' [Tamid 32a]. Be vigilant in all things before you enter into them."" The next sentence is difficult; Gil marks his translation as doubtful and suggests that Ismāʿīl is exhorting his son to be careful about whom he puts his trust in. But perhaps it reads instead, ""wa-lā taṭam'an man yabqa li-yabqa wa-lā lī hūwa waqt yūjibuhu bihi lā ḥīla,"" meaning ""do not trust in [the belief that] 'he who [is destined to] survive, will survive,' for in my view this time does not call for a 'nothing can be done.'"" This would be an unusual use of ""lā ḥīla,"" since usually the writer means to say, ""nothing can be done [except trust in God]."" But it would fit the preceding exhortation to be exceedingly vigilant and to consider the consequences of his actions instead of simply trusting in God. ASE.

Faraḥ, in Alexandria, to his son Faraḥ b. Ismāʿīl, in Būṣīr. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dating: Gil suggests 23 September 1056 CE. This is because the letter was written on 12 Tishrei, likely the same day that Ismāʿīl b. Faraḥ wrote T-S 10J15.4 to Nahray b. Nissim. Gil dates T-S 10J15.4 on the basis of its similarity to BL OR 5542.9, which was written when Monday fell on the 27th of Elul, which apparently happened in 1053 CE and 1056 CE, and of the two he believes 1056 CE to be a better fit. The letter possibly contains information about Nahray’s eye disease, a report that Ismāʿīl will soon travel to the villages to buy linen, and the news about the bad events that are happening in Sicily. (Information from Gil, Kingdom, Vol. 3, #491) VMR. Nahray is known from other letters to have suffered from ophthalmia, but it is not clear that his eye disease figures in this letter. Gil reads, ""bi-mā tabaqqarat lahu ʿaynuhu, wa-innahu ʿalā ʿayn mā tarāhu"" (r5–6), and translates, ""that his eye split open and he stands to lose his vision in one eye."" However, when the phrase עלי עין מא תראה appears in other Geniza letters it seems to refers to a temporary not seeing or not being seen, e.g. ""do not buy anything if eye-does-not-see"" (T-S 13J26.22) or ""if my son turns out to be a worthless employee, get rid of him ('make him eye-does-not-see')"" (T-S 24.78); cf. also ENA NS 10.19. The second clause in the sentence in this letter could also be wa-anta ʿalā ʿayn mā tarāhu, meaning '[you received word from Nahray about X] without having seen him.' The first clause is difficult to read; the form ""tabaqqara"" does not appear in Arabic dictionaries, and it is possible that the word ʿaynahu is actually ʿaybahu. In sum, both the reading and the meaning of the sentence are obscure, but it is likely that there is no information here about Nahray's eye disease. Corroborating evidence for the absence of illness is that Ismāʿīl wrote to Nahray on the same day (T-S 10J15.4) and two days later (T-S 8.66) and did not send good wishes for a recovery.

Hārūn, who had married into the al-Qābisī family, asks Nahray to collect debts for him from various people in Fustat, and to help his sister's son, Yosef b. Peraḥ al-Qābisī, to buy goods with said money. If there isn't enough money, Salmān instructs, then he should sell a quantity of soap deposited with in Fustat with a wakīl.

One used for the occasion the same phrase 'I congratulate you' as one did with good wishes for holy days or a marriage or a safe return from a journey. T-S 13J17.2 is characteristic in this respect. The copyist of the letter had expressed his good wishes for Nahray's recovery from his serious eye disease. His boss had forgotten to do so but obviously read what the scribe had added.

Both read ""mayyit"" (incurable, fatal) instead of ʿayītu, but as the next word is almost illegible, the only way to decide between the two readings is via comparing it with Nissim's other מs and עs. Goitein reads ""wajba"" instead of ""wajjahtu"" and understands it as ""the prescription of the doctor."" Goitein suggests that he is ""sitting on his heels"" five times or more in order to urinate, whereas Gil remains agnostic about why he has to sit down. Perhaps it is simply to rest.

Yaʿaqov is optimistic that these men will return with the ḥajj caravans. As for the two yeshivot, Yaʿaqov declined to join either one of them so as not to offend the other. He told them that he had made a vow to visit the graves of holy men (Gil suggests specifically the grave of Ezekiel).

His son Abū l-Barakāt then became ill with a very high constant fever (""like a blazing fire""). Yaʿaqov sent to Baghdad for materia medica and mixed the medicinal syrup (sharāb) for his son himself, which he gave him each day together with barley water (mā' al-shaʿīrūn). His son is now feeling better. At first they were staying in the house of Abū Saʿd 'the paqid' b. Khalaf (probably a relative, at least by marriage, see verso lines 4–5), but when he and his family became ill, they 'cut off' their guests, ""and you know that the people of Shamṭuniyya, even when they are healthy, do not care for foreigners."" The saving grace for Yaʿaqov was that the people of Shamṭuniyya needed his services as a physician.

The main topic of the letter is a great disaster that befell the writer and many other merchants. Of a convoy of five ships, three, carrying a load to the value of about 200,000 dinars, were lost. In the ship carrying the writer's goods, there were ten Jews, prominent in their home town (most probably Tripoli), who, in addition to merchandise to the value of 7,000 dinars, lost all their money, belongings and even clothing. The writer's cargo amounted to 500 d., of which 320 d. were his own and the rest on commission. One of the Jewish travellers, Abū l-Faḍl b. Abū l-Yumn al-Dimashqī, known to the addressee from a previous visit to Fustat, perished. As the writer obviously was hit hard by that disaster, he asks his friend to take steps to coerce merchants owing him money—Siman Tav (not Tov), Abū Manṣūr, and Jaʿfarī—to fulfill their obligations. In addition, the letter deals with many other business affairs. In a postscript, the writer reports that the banker (ṣārafī, to be pronounced ṣayrafī) Abū l-Maʿālī died bankrupt, owing people about a thousand dinars, to Jews alone about 600, and to the writer 27d.

In the name of the Merciful, Compassionate. 
O assembly of Muslims, and Fugitives, and Helpers. O people of the Prophet (peace upon him), O bearers of the Qurʾān, O people of the Prophet (peace upon him), of fasters of the month of Ramaḍān, I am a man who has detached himself from the sons of Ḥunayy b. Akhṭab b. Hanina of Khaybar, whom we came and overpowered, [to whom] our foot made war, and [whom] our horses carried away. We freely gave up our persons and provisions six days in the lustrous week. Then out came to us our mother, viz. the mother of al-Ḥunayy b. Akhṭab, saying: ""Sabbath has come and the time of prayer."" We answered her: ""We have neither Sabbath, nor feast, nor rest, nor sleep, until the Prophet of Allah (may Allah pray for him and greet him) fulfill that which Allah has inspired him with."" The Prophet of Allah (may, &c.) accepted this, and our Sabbath was not incumbent upon us. He married Safiyya, the daughter of our uncle, and gave her her freedom and marriage gift. And he wrote for us a treaty and covenant. . .  ʿAlī b. Abū Ṭālib (may, &c.), that he should take the letter out, kiss it, draw it over his face, and read it [as follows]:

In the name of the Merciful, Compassionate. 
This is a letter from Muḥammad, the Messenger of Allah to Ḥanina and the people of Khaybar and Maqnā and their progeny as long as the heavens are above the earth, peace. I praise unto you God, save whom there is no God but he. Now [I say that] he has revealed unto me that you are about to return to your cities and to the inhabitants of your dwelling-place. Return in safety, in the protection of Allah and that of his Messenger. Yours is the safeguard of Allah and that of his Messenger with regard to your persons, belief, and property, slaves, and whatever is in your possession. You shall not have the annoyance of land-tax, nor shall a forelock of yours be cut off. No army shall tread on your soil, nor shall you be assembled [for military service], nor shall tithes be imposed on you, neither shall you be injured in any way. No one shall leave his mark on you, you shall not be prevented from wearing slashed or coloured garments, nor from riding horseback, nor from carrying any kind of arms. If any one attacks you, fight him, and if he is killed in the war against you, none of you shall be executed for his sake, nor is ransom to be paid for him. If one of you kills a Muslim intentionally, he shall be dealt with according to Muslim law. No disgraceful charges shall be brought against you, and you shall not be as other [non-Muslim] poll-tax payers. If you ask assistance, it shall be granted to you, and if you want help you shall have it. You shall not be punished for white, nor yellow, nor brown (garments), nor for a coat of mail, nor .... Not a shoe-lace of yours shall be cut. You shall not be hindered entering the mosques, nor precluded from governing Muslim. You shall have no other ruler except out of your own midst, or from the family of the messenger of Allah. Room shall be made for your funerals, except when they trespass on a sacred spot (mosque). You shall be held in honour on account of your own high station and the station of Ṣafiyya, the daughter of your Uncle. It shall be incumbent upon the people of the house of the Messenger of Allah and upon the Muslims to uphold your honour, and not to touch you (?). If any of you goes on a journey, he shall be under the safeguard of Allah and his Messenger. ""There is no compulsion in matters of religion."" If any of you follows the religion of the Messenger of Allah and his command, he shall have one fourth of what the Messenger of Allah has ordered to be given to the people of his house, to be given when the Quraysh receive their portions, viz. fifty dinars. This is a present from me for you. The family of the house of the Messenger of Allah as well as the Muslims are charged to fulfill all that is in this letter. Whoever deserves well of Ḥanina and the people of Khaybar and Maqnā, all the better for him; but he who does them evil, all the worse for him. Whoever reads this my letter, or to whomever it is read, and he alters or changes anything of what is in it, upon him shall be the curse of Allah and the curse of the cursing of. . . and all mankind. He is beyond my protection and intercession on the day of Resurrection, and I am his foe. And who is my foe is the foe of Allah, and he who is the foe of Allah goes to hell. . . and bad is the abode there. Witness is Allah, like whom there is no God, and Allah is sufficient as witness, and his angels. . ., and those Muslims who are present. ʿAlī, the son of Abū Ṭālib, wrote it with his writing, whilst the Messenger of Allah dictated to him letter for letter, Friday, the 3rd of Ramaḍān, in the year five of the Hijra. Witnesses: [ʿAmm]ār b.

Sulaymān b. al-Shāmī, in ʿAydhāb. In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated: Ṭevet 1452 Seleucid = December 1140 / January 1141 CE. Deals with business matters, mentioning commodities such as camphor, brazilwood, and frankincense. 

Goitein's handwritten description in his notes:
""The letter is directed to the East African port ʿAidhāb, for the writer like asks the receiver to take action there, cf. top, l.1–verso, l.7. It was sent from Cairo, for the sender reports that people were going up to ʿAidāb top, ll. 6–8, and he includes a list of prices with the request to buy at the receiver's place. No. 244 is instructive in various respects. It shows us the motivation of the representative of the merchants of Cairo as that of ʿAidhāb. The way in which Abū Zikrī asks the receiver to look after the novice Mufaḍḍạl, verso ll.7–14, is tantamount to an outright command and the same could be said about his order to deal with the goods saved from the Dībājī's ship, margin l.6–verso l.7. Likewise we find the Wakīl of ʿAidhab in charge of the goods saved from Dībājī's boat, although another man, Akbar, had received them. To be sure, the merchants concerned, both Muslims and Jews, had entrusted the Wakīl with this task. On the other hand, it is astonishing that the Muslim merchants and one Jew, Nahrai, had to make the long and dangerous journey from Cairo to ʿAidhāb in order to take over their goods. [[Most probably great quantities were involved.]] In no. [reference to be inserted later] we find Nahrai setting out from ʿAidhāb in the Dībājī's boat. Here, it is to be understood that he had come back in the same. If the goods saved were pepper, lac and brazilwood it is safe to assume that the ship did not founder, in which case these products were likely to be spoiled, but was captured by pirates and later on recaptured, most probably by the Fatimid fleet. It is interesting to learn from our letter, l.19–margin l.1, that a merchant could take a credit from the Dīwān, government, in ʿAidhāb. It cannot be assumed that for this he needed the recommendation of representatives of the merchants, as Abū Zikrī would have certainly referred to a relevant document attached. The reason for this extraordinary precaution obviously was the following: the Oriental goods were sent ""en bloc"", with the share, qisṭ, of each merchant indicated in the list handed over to the Wakīl. A considerable part of the sending was lost, margin l. 7. The merchants obviously did not trust the Wakīl to portion off the remainder equitably. About this important aspect of the Wakīl's office, see [reference to be inserted later].""","Marina Rustow. ; S. D. Goitein, India Book 5. ; S. D. Goitein, index cards. ; S. D.

Netanʾel (here called Abū Saʿīd b. Hibatallāh al-Dimyāṭī). Dating: 1132 CE. This short letter was sent by Abū Zikrī Kohen, the merchant's clerk in Fustat, to Ḥalfon shortly after he left for Qūṣ, on the way to the east. Abū Zikrī Kohen served as Ḥalfon’s representative and paid a debt to Khiyār for him. Also mentioned here are business affairs of Halfon, in which Abū Zikrī Kohen and Khiyār participated together. Other business affairs were between Halfon and Abū Zikrī Kohen alone. Several other personalities were mentioned, some of them known from other places, some of them unknown. The small sums of a few tens of dinars mentioned are probably leftovers from larger transactions. Ḥalfon intended to stay for a certain period in Qūṣ, because Abū Zikrī Kohen knew that he would be there when the letter and the few goods he sent there reached him. From there Ḥalfon intended to go to Aden, and Abū Zikrī Kohen ordered pearls from there for his little son. The letter was written in 1132, and it is alluded to in Abū Zikrī Kohen’s letter to Ḥalfon, from Fustat to Aden, doc. ח15 , ll. 7–13. Abū Zikrī Kohen asked Ḥalfon to write to him from wherever he could get to. This letter opens / refers to itself with the phrase ""tadhkira mubāraka.""

Dated: Adar I 1448 Seleucid = January/February 1134 CE. He writes that after Ḥalfon traveled to India and returned to Aden, the people in Egypt expected him to return home. But then merchants arrived in Egypt from Aden and reported that he was staying there. Previously Ḥalfon had deposited a quantity of pepper in Aden, which he had purchased for Abū Zikrī. He had already written to Maḥrūz b. Yaʿaqov concerning the prices of oriental goods in Egypt, and there was a similar list in the hands of the Egyptian merchant Abū Naṣr b. Avraham, who was then working in Aden. Abu Zikri urges Ḥalfon to buy goods in Aden and return to Egypt. However, if Ḥalfon wishes to return to India, Abu Zikri asks him to leave the pepper in the hands of Yosef b. Avraham, because this is already the third year that Abu Zikri cannot travel to Yemen. According to Abu Zikri, Ḥalfon's previous trip to India was unnecessary. Had he bought goods in Yemen and returned to Egypt in that year he would have made a good profit, for even the young and inexperienced merchants at that time in Egypt made immense profits from the goods they bought in Yemen. At the end of the letter, there are greetings to Ḥalfon from his family and the writer and a request to greet the important people of Aden and to help Abu Nasr b. Avraham.

Yiṣḥaq, Aden, written for Ḥalfon b. Netanʾel in Bharuch, and the only account that survived in the Geniza that a merchant in Aden sent to a business partner in India. Dating: ca. 1134 CE. Sent together with IV,21 (now a new join by Amir Ashur: T-S AS 148.9 + T-S AS 148.197, PGPID 5466), which is a letter from Khalaf b. Yiṣḥaq to Ḥalfon b. Netanʾel. In this account, Khalaf summarizes an entire year of his commercial activities on behalf of Ḥalfon. Includes pepper (828 out of 1469 dinars) and textiles (578.21 dinars), plus a small amount of musk. The amount of 1469 dinars isn't the total amount of business that Khalaf conducted for Ḥalfon, since he didn't sell everything — the pepper, most likely because its price had dropped (r35). Khalaf doesn’t request payment for his services, because the stationary merchant, unlike the traveling merchant, traded for partners outside his home port not in exchange for compensation, but on the basis of reciprocity. Almost all the proceeds were invested immediately in new transactions that had to be done in India. In addition to coral, whose value reached nearly one third of the shipment's value, precious metals were used for this purpose: gold coins and silver (ingots or tools). He gives prices in the coin of Aden, the Malikī dinar, corresponding to 24 qīrāṭs, while textiles are traded in units of kawragha (pl. kawārigh), which is a bundle of twenty thawb (pl. athwāb; the word means not only cloak, but the unit of fabric of the size needed to make one). Also relates to the transactions discussed in a letter from Halfon to Maḍmūn b. Yefet, IV,18 (T-S 13J25.13, PGPID 9059).

Khalaf had sent goods with Abū l-Yumn al-Maḥallī and Abū Zikrī al-Ṣā'igh to Egypt for Abū ʿImrān Ibn Nufayʿ and at that time had asked Ḥalfon to help Abū ʿImrān with the sales and purchases (r17–23). But Abū ʿImrān died, and Ḥalfon traveled to the West, and the two messengers suppressed Khalaf's letters and acted as if the merchandise belonged to them (r23–27). Abū l-Yumn was going to return to Aden, but he fell ill in Qūṣ and had to return to Fustat, and Khalaf does not know his current condition. Abū Zikrī al-Ṣā'igh is planning to travel on to the West. He had with him a container (mikḥala) of musk that was destined for Ḥalfon, but the head of the Jews, Maẓliāh Gaon, took the container from him before he traveled (r27–38). Khalaf has already asked Abū Zikrī Kohen, the representative of the merchants, to go to the courts with the purpose of recouping the value of the goods Khalaf has lost and sending the money back to Aden. In this letter, Khalaf asks Ḥalfon to assist Abū Zikri Kohen in this (r38–53). The letter continues with other business matters, including an update on the shipment of nard (sunbul) for Ḥalfon and his partner Mubārak al-Māliqī (i.e., from Malaga) that was detained in al-Qaṣṣ, evidently a location in NW India (r53–v3). Khalaf concludes with regards for Maṣliaḥ Gaon; for Ḥalfon's brother ʿEli Nezer ha-Maskilim; and for ""the congregations."" Khalaf is preoccupied that he has received no letters from Ḥalfon (v4–10).

If he violates the agreement, Yosef must pay twenty mithqāls 'to the poor of Almeria and the captives.' The deed was written by a professional scribe, but the addition on verso is by Ḥalfon himself. Just as document ח26 opens with the statement of the active partner, Yosef b. Shuʿayb Ibn al-Najera, who received money from Ḥalfon to trade in, so here Ḥalfon gave money to Yosef to trade in. If so, we have before us two partnership deeds that were written in the West between Ḥalfon, the investor, and a 'dealer' named Yosef, and it turns out that this refers to the same partner. Since it was agreed that if Yosef broke the agreement, he will give twenty mithqāls 'to the poor of Almeria and to the captives', this document was presumably written in Spain, at the time when Ibn Al-Najera visited Ḥalfon, in Lucena, at the beginning of July 1138.

The first draft is partial and appears to be an incomplete version of the second draft. This is a letter addressed to an unnamed Jewish courtier in Fustat. The third draft is likely addressed to the Head of the Jews, probably the new Nagid Shemuel b. Ḥananya. In this letter, Ḥalfon apologizes for not having presented himself in person or having written earlier. He blames this on his wretched condition in the wake of his illnesses (v16–18) and the tribulations of his four-year journey to the Maghrib and to al-Andalus. In particular, he has been shaken by the deaths of his brother and the death of 'our diadem and crown and master and head' (v19–21); Goitein concludes that the references are to Ḥalfon's brother ʿEli and to the head of the Yeshiva, Maṣliah Gaon. Presumably, Ḥalfon wrote these drafts during the period he spent in Alexandria upon his return from the West to Egypt in April 1139 CE.

Dated/dating: Iyar 1140. Yeḥezqel complains rather winningly and at great length about his various business problems: ""I'm oppressed, but being painted an oppressor"" (anā maẓlūm fī ṣūrat ẓālim), i.e., I’m being blamed for things that aren’t my fault. The problems in question: their cheese venture (see IB ח69, ח68, ח64) and the legal proceedings related to it, on which the judges were unable to reach a decision; goods delayed in the bayt al-wakīl, about which the judges wanted the parties to reach a compromise; and a legal action related to the sale of a house, with judges unable to reach a decision: should the decision be according to the approach of Hayye Gaʾon or Yiṣḥaq al-Fāsī? One of the judges suggests to Yeḥezqel that Ḥalfon should have solicited a responsum (fatwā) from Ibn Mīgash, which would have strengthened their hand. Also discusses trade in donkeys (sold without tack because otherwise the price would have been higher) and a long story about transporting silk from the village of Banhā in the delta together with a tax-farmer named Abū Saʿd (perhaps the same one who appears as a former tax-farmer 25 years later in T-S 13J2.24 = PGPID 1008). This Abū Saʿd the tax-farmer (ḍāmin) worked as a pair with a ḍāmin from Cairo, and so couldn't just show up in Banhā at the drop of a hat to help Yeḥezqel transport Abū Zikrī Kohen's silk back to Qalyūb (an eight-hour walk according to Google Maps). Moreover, two tax officials — a fellow tax-farmer in the dār al-ṣināʿa, the main customs point entering Fustat (see Med. Soc. .2:360, 606n34) and the tax-collector (mushidd, an Ayyubid term for the tax-collector at ports, on which Friedman cites Cahen, ’Le régime des impôts dans le Fayyūm ayyūbide,’ Arabica 3 [1956], 19), meaning the one working at the dār al-ṣināʿa? — ""don't let him take (even) one raṭl (of silk) as a fee (or bribe?), or it's said to him, 'That's not yours!' The injustice is rampant."" Unclear whether here we have the striking picture of a tax-farmer deeming it an injustice that his superiors forbid him from taking bribes; he uses the Hebrew word ḥamas, which in this period, according to Friedman, is a technical term for government-imposed injustice, so perhaps this is by comparison to some earlier period, when it was understood that tax-collectors could enrich themselves in kind. Mentions the death of Abū Naṣr b. al-Minqār, who was Ibn Yijū’s cousin, the son of his maternal aunt. Mentions the India trader Abū ʿAlī b. al-Kirnīb, who also appears in Maimonides' responsa. Although the names of the writer and addressee aren't stated explicitly because the letter has no address (it was probably hand-delivered), Goitein and Friedman identified them based on content and paleography.

Probably written after Ḥalfon traveled to Alexandria to meet Yehuda ha-Levi. Yeḥezqel writes about the fear that gripped him when Ḥalfon left and boarded the boat, while ill and without any companion. The body of the letter deals with business matters, especially recounting disputes with others regarding debts. Yeḥezqel was helpled by Abū l-Waḥsh Sibāʿ. One of these disputes was with the 'youths' (ṣibyān) who owed money to Yeḥezqel. These youths recruited their Muslim neighbors against Yeḥezqel and threatened that their mother would appeal to the state authorities (al-sulṭān) to exempt them from repaying the debt until ('God forbid!' interjects Yeḥezqel) they recover from their illness. Yeḥezqel had already involved two trustees of the court and the Nagid himself, but the youths too appealed to the Nagid. Yeḥezqel continues with the matter of a certain aristocrat named Razīn al-Dawla, who is angry because he had given Yeḥezqel to purchase a garment for the winter, and the order had not been fulfilled. Yeḥezqel asks Ḥalfon to make haste in obtaining the garment, which should be in a beautiful yellow. It may be sent to Yeḥezqel in Qalyūb or to 'the Jew' (the tax farmer) in Shaṭnūf, which is the iqṭāʿ of Razīn al-Dawla. Yeḥezqel asks for news of Ḥalfon's arrival in Alexandria and asks him to convey an apology to Yehuda ha-Levi for not having written to him or come to Alexandria to greet him in person.

ʿAmram b. Yiṣḥaq sends Ḥalfon a short greeting for Purim. Abu Al-Ma'ali wanted to help Abu Al-Fakhr, the son of Ḥalfon’s brother, Abu Ali Yeḥezqel, to do what he had not succeeded in doing. As it appears from his words, the intention is probably to get married, and it is possible that Abu al-Ma'ali wanted to offer him a match. Amram asked for Ḥalfon’s help in the matter and expressed his sorrow that Ḥalfon also failed to reach the implied goal, which was to marry a wife. According to Amram, Abu Al-Fakhr was like one of his sons, an expression that alludes to the familial closeness between them.

Ḥalfon had already described to Saʿdān the difficult illness of Yeḥezqel. According to Saʿdān, the deposit of silk which Ḥalfon had deposited with him was not sufficient to repay the debt.

This document was written after the payment of the debt that is the subject of CUL Or.1080 J284 (ח88), a letter from Abū ʿUmar Saʿdān b. Thābit Levi Baghdādī (Seʿadya ha-Levi b. Yakhin) to Ḥalfon, in which he asked Ḥalfon not to travel to Damascus without repaying the debt of his (still-living) brother Abū ʿAlī Yeḥezqel, a sum of 45 3/4 dinars. Ḥalfon had previously given a collateral of silk to Saʿdān. The present document deals with the sale of the silk, part of whose proceeds (43 2/3 dinars) paid off part of the debt (25 dinars), which means that Ḥalfon must have paid the remaining balance of 20 3/4 dinars from his own money. Between the writing of the previous document and this one, Abū ʿAlī Yeḥezqel died. Ḥalfon's nephew Abū Naṣr Shemuel b.

Dating: 1133–36 CE (see PGPID 9140 for rationale). Partnership agreement. In this unsigned and undated draft, an unnamed active partner receives 200 dinars from Sibāʿ, with which he is to travel to Alexandria and transact in unnamed commodities. Sibāʿ agrees to share equally in all losses to the partnership as a whole (e.g. losses due to work stoppage or broken merchandise). Lines 12-16 indicate that if commodities may end up traveling for sale in Alexandria escorted by someone other than the active partner, the active partner should inform Sibāʿ. The risk of loss is wholly carried by Sibāʿ. The active partner’s testimony concerning profits and losses does not require the support of witness testimony. The active partner seems to be entitled to all profits except for the maintenance of Sibāʿ(excluding Sibāʿ's rent and education costs for his son). Sibāʿ's share of the profits – a fixed amount unrelated to the success of partnership assets – might contravene the rabbinic prohibition of usury, but he does bear responsibility for losses. The use of the first person throughout the document suggests that it was prepared and notarized for the active partner, as with powers of attorney. The active partner could then present it as supporting documentation in the event of a dispute concerning distribution of partnership profits.

MS heb. c 28/31,,,,Letter,"India, illness letter 969-1517, IB4, illness: grief, Illness","Letter from Ḥalfon b. Netanʾel ha-Levi, in Alexandria, to Yiṣḥaq Ibn ʿEzra, in Spain. In Judaeo-Arabic. The letter deals with the death of Ḥalfon's brother and other notables and the series of disasters that struck Ḥalfon and the community. Dating: probably January 1140 CE (though Goitein originally believed it to be 1129 CE, he later revised his dating and Friedman agrees). (Information from Goitein and Friedman, India Book IV.) Goitein summarizes the letters as follows: ""A perfect picture of the influence of emotions on physical and mental health is found in the long letter written by the noble India trader Ḥalfon b. Netanel nine months after his return to Egypt from a long sojourn in Spain. As expected from a man like him, he dedicates the first twenty lines to the praise of his gracious and learned hosts, whom he so greatly missed. Then he goes on to bemoan one after another the disasters that disturbed his mind: civil war, anarchy, the high cost of living in Egypt, the death of the Head of the Jerusalem Academy (which then had its seat in Cairo) and of several luminaries of the Jewish spiritual and social upper crust; hardly had the months of mourning for those passed when Halfon's misfortune was topped by the demise of his eldest brother, who was the president of the Jewish High Court of Justice. He found himself unable to act, even to supervise the unloading of his goods, and let the perishables rot. During his long stay in Alexandria his body and soul never enjoyed full health, but he was also unable to bring himself to go up to Cairo: how could he visit the place vacated by his brother? Family and friends came down to Alexandria to induce him to return home, but he did not find in himself nahḍa, energy, to do so. For this reason, he was also not in a position to send to his friends in Spain (mostly physicians) the pharmaceutical plants promised, for these were to be had only in the capital (the terminal of the India trade), not in the Mediterranean port. Nor for the time being was he in a frame of mind to continue writing the learned discussions that were started during his sojourn in Spain. He concludes with a refined twist; he really did not want to send this letter but he was overcome by yearning for his Spanish friends, and asks them, considering his state of mind, to overlook his shortcomings in style and script (in that order).""

It seems that at least two children remained with the husband.

Shelomo gives a detailed account of the Almohad invasions and persecutions in the West from 1145 to the present-day (on the day he wrote the letter, a messenger arrived with the news that Bejaia had fallen to the Almohads). He also gives a detailed description of his illness. ""As for me, after having opened a shop, a great general depression (kasār) occurred. I was ill for nine months with tertiary fever (al-muthallatha) and fever of the liver (ḥummā l-kabd). Neither I, nor anyone else believed that I would recover from this. In the wake of the illness, difficulties in breathing (ḍīq nafas) befell me, which lasted two months. Had I not made up my mind to leave the business, I would have perished. At present, I do nothing, sitting partly in the qāʿa [workshop or Bible school] of Joseph and partly in the store of the Son of the Scholar. I study a good part of the night with him every night"" (Goitein, Med Soc, V, p. 337). Shelomo concludes with a profuse expression of filial dedication: “Please, with the help of the Almighty, may the reply to this my letter be the sight of you, if God wills. Be not enticed by business so that you forget us. For—by my faith in Heaven—every additional day of your absence takes a year from our lives. Consider that the life of the son of man is nothing but light. You are our light. If you are not with us, how can we live?” (Goitein, Med.

Dating: 1103. Complains in rhyme about the hardships of travel. He had run into Makhlūf b. Moshe, known as ʿAyn Sarra (Goitein's rendering of the name, ""the son of the man with the gladdening eye(s),"" missed the interlinear addition; Elbaum and Rustow render it ""Happy Eyes""), who told him about how pleasant life was in India, and at least as the writer represents the situation to his brother-in-law — guiltily, as he had left home without saying goodbye — he somewhat spontaneously decided to travel to India. It would be significant if the barriers to entering the Indian Ocean trade were as low as they seem here. Yet he also complains — with puns — about various locations in the Red Sea (ʿAydhāb/ʿadhāb, Dahlak/muhlik, etc), again presumably in order to reassure his brother-in-law that he wasn't actually enjoying himself. On Happy Eyes, Goitein writes that this man had settled in Alexandria, Egypt, where he possessed a valuable house. He also possessed a house in Barqa, eastern Libya. Cf. T-S NS J241. (Goitein, Med. Soc., x, B, 2, 136) On verso, line 1, there is a phrase from Isaiah (25:1), ""emuna omen,"" “steadfast faith,” which seems to be the equivalent of ""burn after reading."" It appears in numerous other geniza letters, usually at the end of the address, but it's only in this letter that its meaning becomes clear: it indicates a confidential letter, absolutely not to be shared with others. Some of its other appearances: Bodl. MS Heb. a 2/16, Bodl. MS Heb. b 11/22, Bodl. MS Heb. c 28/56, Bodl.

Contains 7 entries. Dated: 1532 Seleucid, which is 1220/21 CE. The scribe seems slightly dyslexic (e.g., writes fādiya for fāʾida and ḍamān for ḍāmin). (1) Partnership in a shop. Between [...] Futūḥ and Sulaymān. (2) Lease. Property: Ṭabaqat al-Burj (referring to a tower? or to a dovecote?). Period: 10 years. Lessor: Bū l-Faraj Ibn al-Abzārī. Lessee: Bū l-ʿAlāʾ al-Ṣabbāgh. Rent: 12 dirhams/month. (3) Involves Makārim b. Bū l-Riḍā. Details are difficult to discern; involves a house, an inheritance, and a sale. This one is signed: Ḥalfon b. Saʿīd ha-Kohen; עזראהל(??) b. Yefet ha-Melammed. (4) Difficult to read and crossed out. Maybe about a partial payment of a debt. (5) Betrothal (shiddukhin). Fiance: Bū l-[...]. Fiancee: Mudallala bt. Mufaḍḍal al-Ṣāʾigh. Delayed marriage payment (muʾakhkhar) is 50 dinars. This entry is incomplete and crossed out. (6) Debt contract. Abū l-ʿAlāʾ and Ismāʿīl the tax farmer of Minyat Ghamr acknowledge that they owe Bū Naṣr the brother-in-law of Sayyidnā (probably Avraham Maimonides) 773.5 dirhams. They will repay the debt over a period of 4 months. Apparently they will pay (the verb used is NQD, ""assay"") the 73.5 dirhams now, to make it a nice round figure. Eliyyahu (b. Zekharya) and Yeḥiel (b. Elyaqim) were the judges present. (7) This entry has been discussed and translated by Moshe Yagur as follows: ""On the margins of the leaf is the first paragraph below, mentioning the birth of a mamzeret (lit. “a bastard girl,” referring to a Jew whose lineage is tainted according to rabbinic law). A paragraph clarifying the reason for the newborn’s legal state is given in perpendicular, noting the conversion of her mother. Thus the document serves as an example of some of the social and legal problems that could result from the marriage of a Jewish apostate. In addition, it suggests enduring ties between converts and their former community, given the prospect that the “bastard” daughter might choose to retain her place in the Jewish community. Translation: A daughter was born to the “son of the known one” (ibn yaʿlamū?) from Bint Ṭuwayr al-ʿAshāʾ, and she is a “bastard” (mamzeret). [It happened] in the year 1532 [of the Seleucid era, corresponding to 616–17/1220–21]. And [she is a bastard] because her mother had apostatized while she was married to Efrayim al-Damīrī, and he did not write a bill of divorce for her, and she married Bu ʿAlī “son of the known one” in a Muslim court [lit. “by non-Jewish law”]."" (Information from Yagur, ""Several Documents from the Cairo Geniza Concerning Conversion to Islam"" (2020).) On the odd name Ṭuwayr al-ʿAshāʾ, perhaps ""evening moth/butterfly,"" see the same name in T-S NS J293c from 80 years earlier and BL OR 5566C.9 (recto l. 26) from slightly earlier than that, and see Goitein's index card #19543 where he wonders if it might be a profession related to the evening meal—but it is clear from the identical name appearing in 3 unrelated documents that Ṭuwayr is part of the name.

Natan (aka Musāfir b. Wahb), in Alexandria, to the Nagid Mevorakh, in Fustat. The sender and addressee are not named in the letter, but Frenkel identified them on the basis of handwriting and content. Dating: toward the end of Mevorakh's tenure as nagid (1094–1111; Frenkel). This long letter, written between the lines of the Arabic text on recto, mentions disputes in the Jewish community, especially an ongoing dispute with the Maghribi community over the payment of the capitation tax. The Banū Naḥum family is involved (a well-known family from Alexandria). The letter also expresses the dissatisfaction of the community with its muqaddam. Araḥ functions in the letter as the 'nā'ib' (deputy) of the Nagid in Alexandria. (Another interpretation of the word niyāba in line 31 would be that ""they [Araḥ's enemies] have destroyed the community in the name of representing you."") In a postscript, Araḥ reports to the Nagid how he dealt with a case of a widow who was exploited. Araḥ complains in passing about the severe illness that he contracted while traveling (lines 14–15), perhaps to support his self-presentation as someone who takes care of the community despite all that it costs him. Information in part from Frenkel. Note that this letter is written on an enormous sheet of paper that originally contained an Arabic state document, subsequently reused for a copy of Shemuel b. Ḥofni's Kitāb al-Shurūṭ on verso, and ultimately torn up and reused for this letter and other documents. Joins: T-S Ar.18(2).193 + T-S Ar.30.306 + T-S Ar.30.314: Marina Rustow.

He asks to be sent some sea squill (ʿunṣul) because he is perishing from a boil or some other skin lesion (ḥabba). As for Sitt al-Yumn, she continues to send (? tawaṣṣalat fī tasyīr) the bath clogs (qabqāb), and he wishes he could repay her adequately but is unable to travel to Alexandria because of the capitation tax, though he does wish to (leave Fustat and?) be closer to al-Shām. He urges his paternal aunt and her daughter—probably the same Sitt al-Yumn mentioned previously and the same Sitt al-Yumn whom Shelomo is known to have wooed unsuccessfully from T-S 13J18.22, CUL Add.3343 and T-S 13J34.9—to come stay with him. He cannot bear separation from her. ""My uncle Bū Manṣūr, she is your daughter, and I am your son! Whatever you see fit that should be done, do it."" He adds a postscript saying that he has been approached by four different distinguished families this very week alone (presumably with wedding offers), ""and if you do not come, you will hear about one of them, and you will regret it, and you will make me regret it, for I yearn for you (pl.) and seek you (pl.).""

When the nāẓir Abū l-Munā arrived in Damīra, the sender and the group/community went to him and registered a complaint against a certain Ibrāhīm, saying, ""there is no good or honor in this, that a Jew should oppose the honoring of our master the noble Rayyis"" (וקאל לא כיר לה ולא כראמה [פי] אן יעארץ יהודי אכראם למולי אלריס אלגליל).

Mentions someone's brother 'our Rabbi Mevasser.' Greetings to the cantor Hiba and to R. Yaʿqūb.

The details of the case are difficult to follow and merit deeper examination. Menaḥem's enemies have gotten the upper hand, and they are gloating to the utmost, and he has lost a great deal of money. In what remains of the letter, he first mentions the visit of Lu'lu' (""may the enemies of Israel perish""), who may be identical with al-Raqqī, to a prison (where Menaḥem had been held?). The entirety of the rest of the story has to do with the misdeeds of al-Raqqī and Ibn Kātib al-ʿArab, called ""dogs"" by the writer (they call him the same). The latter ""stands in the middle of the markets [of Fusṭāṭ and Cairo] and hosts great gatherings (? maḥāfil), even greater than those of al-Raqqī. He said that I am his enemy and that I testified against him to the representative of the sultan"" (r12–15, 29). Apparently the addressee normally has the ear of Ibn Kātib al-ʿArab, and so none of this would have happened if the addressee had not had to travel ""for my sins"" (r24–25). Menaḥem writes repeatedly that he is ""in the fire"" and that it would be better to be dead (r25–31, v21–25). His uncle (ʿamm) Abū l-Faraj is egging on al-Raqqī, standing in the market and ""on the slaughterhouse"" (?) and cursing Menaḥem and the addressee before the Jews and the Muslims. Abū l-Faraj is instructing al-Raqqī not to ""appraise these pawns"" (hādhihi l-ruhūnāt lā tuqawwimuhum) (does Menaḥem run a pawnshop?) (r32–36). The villainy of Abū l-Faraj goes deeper, for he ""sits in the house with Yūsuf and his brothers and his children, dancing (raqṣ) and listening to music (ṭarab) (rm22–33). The installment of the story that continues on verso has to do with al-Raqqī's claim that he is owed 1000 nuqra (dirhams) by the addressee. Various legal documents and (false?) witnesses are produced (v1–15). Someone states, ""This is how fortunes are lost because of slander"" (v12). Menaḥem expands on his wretched state. He prays for God to command the ""angel of my misfortunes"" to relent. Every day ends with tears and with the melting of his liver, bit by bit (v19–32). He concludes by urging the addressee to come quickly and to seek aid from a powerful man (""kiss the feet for me of he whom you know,"" v33–34). He apologizes for the distressing matter contained in the letter (v35–37). R. David sends his regards and rebukes; R. Shelomo is well, recovering, back to his usual self; the addressee's wife and children are well (v37–40).

The writer heard from Manṣūr al-Dimashqī ""may God protect him"" (possibly identical with the recipient Abū Ṭāhir—otherwise how is Abū Ṭāhir connected to the story?) that he has been drawn into the matter of Mūsā b. al-Maghribī's capitation tax. Mūsā had been selling off his qumāsh (household furnishings? his wife's dowry?) when he went to the governor (al-wālī), possibly of al-Benha, and said ""this man [presumably the letter writer] is my guarantor (ḍamīnī), and I make my payment in Malīj."" The governor said, ""Impossible! Show me your acquittances (barāwātak)."" Mūsā brought the acquittances. The sequence of events becomes blurry around here due to the missing ends of lines. A speculative reconstruction is as follows: The governor said that he had been ordered to collect the capitation tax from a group of people who still owed it for ""years 8 and 9"" but it then transpired that the record (al-jarīda) in the tax bureau (al-dīwān) showed that someone else had already collected their capitation taxes—perhaps because they, like Mūsā, were registered elsewhere? The governor then says he will take the list to the authorities (al-sulṭān) and report that these people actually live in his district. The text in the margin is fragmentary but mentions the capitation tax farmer in Malīj (ḍāmin al-jawālī bi-Malīj) and, later, ""let him pay it in al-Benha."" The upper margin is lost. When the story resumes on verso, someone—perhaps the governor of al-Benha—is saying, ""I will not let you off without a capitation tax payment for year 8, as the authorities (al-sulṭān) have ordered."" The writer continues, ""We are in a difficult situation with him [perhaps the tax farmer of Malīj]."" The writer concludes by beseeching Abū Ṭāhir at least twice not to ""oppose (tuʿāriḍ). . . [something or someone] that is in al-Benha."" The meaning of this is not immediately clear. Perhaps the writer, in Malīj, is now facing trouble with the local tax farmer, because the governor of al-Benha is trying to transfer the tax revenue to his own district, and the writer wishes Abū Ṭāhir and Mūsā would not stir up any further trouble with the authorities. See Moss. IV,7 (L 12) for another use of עארץ in relation to the capitation tax.

The family apparently asked Moshe (a cantor) to lead the services. Over 40 people packed into the house incuding a group from al-Mah[allah?]. He started praying, but it seems quietly and to himself. The congregants shouted at him that he had to pray out loud and with 'cantorship' (אלחזאנה) in the 'new' style. Moshe, however, had forgotten how to do this (performance anxiety?) and so he had to continue praying 'without cantorship.'

In Judaeo-Arabic. Dated: 1468 Seleucid = 1156/57 CE. The sender claims that he only reluctantly agreed, as a favor to the addressee, to go on a business venture to the Levant and sell four qinṭārs of Levantine flax on behalf of the addressee. The goods were originally assessed by the addressee and by Abū ʿAlī to value 34 dinars after the sender had paid 4 dinars for dues in Damietta and for the hire of a ship. When he arrived in Tyre, he sold part of the shipment for 71 dinars, of the Tyre standard. He brought the remaining flax with him to Damascus, hoping to make a further profit, but found no market there, ""flax in Damascus is now cheaper than it is Egypt."" He lost 10 dinars as a result. He has now stayed in Damascus for well over six months, potentially a year or more (waiting for the flax prices to go back up?). The addressee, having no received no letters — the sender counters that he sent plenty of letters, but the messengers probably didn't deliver them — appointed a legal representative, Abū l-Faḍl b. al-Masos, to travel to Damascus and sue the sender for the value of a shipment. The lawsuit was conducted in the court of ""our master ʿEzra Rosh Yeshivat Geʾon Yaʿaqov,"" later referred to as ""Sayyidnā al-Gaʾon,"" i.e., ʿEzra b. Avraham, who was still Gaʾon in Damascus when Benjamin of Tudela visited approximately 10 years later. The court ruled against the sender, ordering him to pay the agent the full value of the shipment and to take an oath. In the presence of the Gaʾon, the sender paid the agent 43 dinars for the addressee and an additional 5 dinars for another creditor/investor referred to as ""sayyidnā."" He therefore still owes 13 dinars. The agent demanded the rest of the payment and the oath. The sender bought himself time by insisting that the addressee would never coerce him like this and that he would need to send him a letter before acting. He then complains that he never even wanted to take the addressee's flax; he did it reluctantly as a favor to him and now regrets it. He promises to try to return to Egypt ""in the summer of this year which is 1468.""

Her arguments were as follows: her husband left her for a short time and did not intend to spend the winter away from home; however, by that time he had already been absent more than six months. In order to support herself, she had had to sell whatever remained of her dowry. Even when he is present, he is abusive. Her request of the court was two-fold: a. as mentioned above, to fix her an allowance for living expenses, and b. to confirm in a recorded document that all that she was obliged to sell in order to survive should be regarded as due her from her husband. This latter request was immediately met; but a decision on the former request was delayed, with the hope that the husband would soon return. Because the husband delayed his return, and she repeated her requests for help, it was decided to grant the woman an allowance on a temporary basis.

Khalid who has a son named Abu l-Mahasin. In this version: he describes how he saw the recipient in the kitchen on Sunday and an idea occurred to him that the recipient approved of (possibly to travel to somewhere other than Bilbays?). However, the writer decided it would be better for him to travel to Bilbays. He has not traveled yet, because it is unthinkable to travel when the doors of the house are still in their sorry state: the main door needs to be fixed, and the door of the upper floor/apartment needs to be replaced completely. He alludes to his illness. He then gives his excuse for not having come to attend the recipient (before he traveled?) as requested. He has had a fever since Friday. When he heard that his presence was requested, he was in the middle of Musaf, having just reached Ashrei, and he rushed to fulfill the command but found only the boy Abu l-Mahasin, to whom he explained the matter. He concludes with blessings.

He has not traveled yet, because it is unthinkable to travel when the doors of the house are still in their sorry state: the main door needs to be fixed, and the door of the upper floor/apartmnet needs to be replaced completely. He alludes in very vague terms to his personal difficulties (according to the other copy, a febrile illness since Friday). He then gives his excuse for not having come to attend the recipient (before he traveled?) as requested; he says merely that he had a good reason (in the other copy, he cites his fever) and that he cut off his prayers and tried to fulfill the command. He goes back to the matter of the doors to explain why he has not yet left the house.

30143,https://geniza.princeton.edu/documents/30143/,,,AIU VII.E.158,,,,Letter,Moshe b. Levi,"A much damaged letter from Moshe b. Levi ha-Levi, probably writing from Qalyub, to a family member, probably his father in Fustat. He has sent some money with the bearer and gives very detailed instructions for the drugs to be bought with it--including from which stall and which vendor--such as pomegranate seeds from al-Mahallah and a rhubarb-barberry concoction. On verso he asks his family to send him something that has to do with R. Moshe, plausibly a fatwa that he had sent for Maimonides to answer (such as T-S 10K8.3 + T-S 8K13.8, in his handwriting); or it is just someone else named R. Moshe. He brings up a man named Isma'il from al-Mahallah, known as Ibn al-Mu'allim; at the end he encourages the recipient to treat this Isma'il well, because he is poor and a stranger and from a good family. Isma'il has a notebook stashed with a man named Ibn al-[[rubbed out]], and the recipient is meant to retrieve it and find the chapters having to do with love [spells?]. The recipient is then to ""do them"" to various women in the family of Moshe's paternal uncle (so the brother of the likely recipient) including the uncle's wife, his mother, and her daughter (=Moshe's wife?). This reading is uncertain. But other letters of Moshe survive about his sometimes problematic relationship with his wife and also about domestic problems in his paternal uncle's family. Perhaps this is a novel effort to bring peace to the family (and/or try to make his wife desire him).

(פיכון רשע ארשע מן האדא). (6) ʿUqayb said something about running into Ibn al-Baṭṭāl. (7) He said that Abū ʿImrān cursed me with a curse that would be too long to tell.

The Jew then drew up an Islamic legal document (hujja) and threatened to imprison the Muslim, whereupon they renegotiated the amount of money owed according to the terms of the partnership. The Jewish guy makes a new calculation of the old and new debits and credits and has these new terms drawn up in a Jewish legal document (shetar) in front of a Jewish court (beit din). The query: if the Muslim partner sues the Jew in the beit din and accuses him using the shetar as his documentation, is it permissible for one of them to deny (the validity of) the shetar, and to oblige the other to take an oath swearing that he doesn’t owe the other guy any additional money on account of the prohibition on interest (ribit), or can a punishment be imposed on him on account of the oath?

The narrator explains that he was among those accused of embezzling state funds under the reign of al-Wāthiq and was forced to flee to the wilderness. His riding animal brings him to the lands of Banū Shaybān and he enters the courtyard of a house. A woman calls out to extend hospitality, and he responds ""yā sayyida, how can a frightened, pursued, terrified, persecuted person find peace... no one can rest with the government after him."" She gives him advice and repeats the invitation. The Geniza fragment ends around here. In the parallel version, the woman summons the head of the household (or tribe?) Abū l-Murhaf al-Aswad b.
